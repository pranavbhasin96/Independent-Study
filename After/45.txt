  During the election campaign Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani asserted that the BJP would not win even a single SC constituency. But voters appear to have had other ideas.  Early trends show that the BJP is leading in majority of the seats reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. In seven of the 13 reserved constituencies, BJP is leading with a solid majority, though it needs to be noted that most of these constituencies, with the exception of a few like Kadi, have sitting BJP MLAs. Mr. Mevani, though is set to win from Vadgam. ST constituencies Of the 26 seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes, Congress is leading in 12 seats while BJP is leading in 11. Bharatiya Tribal Party, a Congress ally, is leading in two while an Independent is leading in one. Most of the seats have been retained by the party that won it in the 2012 Assembly election.  However, in certain constituencies such as Santrampur, Jetpur, Chhota Udaipur, Sankheda, Sankheda, Dediapada, Jhagadiya, Nizar and Dharampur, there has been an anti-incumbency trend.  In Kaprada, where the Congress had won with a majority of over 18,000 votes in 2012, the current Congress candidate is holding on to the lead with a meagre 70 votes.
