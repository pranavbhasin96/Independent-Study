 Hours after the results of the Uttar Pradesh polls indicated a massive victory for the BJP, party president Amit Shah addressed the media in New Delhi and thanked the electorate of all the five States that went to the polls. "The BJP will form governments in four of the five States. We have to accept the fact that the Prime Minister is the strongest leader since Independence. The electorate have given a befitting reply to our naysayers," he said. The politics of performance will drive future elections, he declared. "U.P.'s development is essential to India's growth and we can't imagine double-digit growth without its help. We will make sure that we do justice to the faith that people have placed on us,'' he said. In another statement, as a response to a question, he said, "We need to come out of Hindu-Muslim politics. Everyone wants development and performance." Talking about the impact of note ban, he said the people are strongly behind Mr. Modi on his decision to demonetise Rs. 1,000 and old Rs. 500 notes. He hit out at the Opposition for basing their strategy over the issue. "The poll result paves the way for politics that doesn't involve caste or religion," he said. Responding to a question on BSP supremo Mayawati's remarks, he said, "I understand Mayawatiji's state of mind, but don't want to comment on her statement on EVMs."
