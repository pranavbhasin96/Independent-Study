 Disagreeing with the exit poll results that claimed BJPs victory in Uttar Pradesh, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said on Friday that the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would win in the State.  He also recalled that pollsters predictions had failed in Bihar during the Assembly elections there, adding that the same would happen on Saturday after the results.  We will win in Uttar Pradesh. Exit polls projections in Bihar were wrong. We will talk on March 11, he said outside Parliament. Im not giving any opinion on the opinion polls, Mr. Gandhi said.

In such a situation, not a single voter or party would want elections after elections. Therefore, in that situation the most easily available handshake which will ensure a certain amount of continuity in governance without a vacuum will be attempted, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said here.
