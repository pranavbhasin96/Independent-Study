 The Ahmedabad police have denied permission to the BJP and the Congress to hold road shows of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in the city, citing security and law and order concerns, traffic and inconvenience to the public. Both leaders were expected to hold road shows in the city on the last day of campaigning on December 12. We turned down the permission, Ahmedabad police commissioner A.K. singh said. As the campaigning for second phase of polls is coming to a close, both parties have stepped up their electioneering in central and north Gujarat regions that will go to the polls on December 14. A total of 93 seats will go for voting.  Earlier, voting was held in 89 constituencies in Saurashtra and south Gujarat provinces in the first phase on December 9, which witnessed 66.74 per cent turnout that is lower than last time. Mr. Modi will be addressing three rallies on Monday while Mr. Gandhi will address four rallies. Patidar agitation leader Hardik is holding a road show and a public meeting in Ahmedabad on Monday.
