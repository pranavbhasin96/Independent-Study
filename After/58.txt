How Gujarat was won 



 
How Gujarat was won  Gujarat election results are historic. In this day and age, for a party to keep winning for so long is unprecedented, Mr. Modi stated. For me, Gujarat polls are a matter of double happiness. I am so happy that after I left the State, my colleagues and party workers continued their good work, making it possible for the party to win a sixth time. The Prime Ministers 20-minute speech reflected his worries and the partys vulnerabilities despite the victory in their backyard. In Gujarat, 30 years back, the poison of caste was spread so badly that it took workers like me 30 years to get rid of it. In the last few months, there were attempts to again sow the seeds of casteism, but people rejected it. I congratulate them, but people must be alert, he said. However, though the party has won despite the anti-incumbency factor, caste and social agitation and a slowing economy, the State polls turned into a photo finish unlike the landslide some exit polls predicted and much below the BJPs target of winning 150 seats set by party president Amit Shah. Saurashtra, the BJPs stronghold since 1995, dealt the party a big blow, as the Congress won 30 out of 54 seats in the region. In some districts such as Morbi, Gir Somnath and Amreli, the BJP could not even open its account while it nearly got wiped out in Surendranagar and Junagadh.
