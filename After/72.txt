 High drama ensued in Manipur over the disappearance and alleged kidnapping of the lone independent MLA on Sunday as both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are claiming that they have numbers to form government in the northeastern State. According to Manipur Congress leadership Ashad Uddin, an independent MLA who won from Jiribam Assembly seat securing 8,189 votes, had ensured his support to Congress. However, when he reached Imphal Airport, with another Congress leader Abdul Nasir, he was taken away by the BJP leaders, Congress alleged.  On behest of the BJP, Independent candidate Asab Uddin (Jiribam, Manipur) has been detained forcefully by CISF and flown to an unknown location, AICC leader C.P. Joshi who is in Manipur said on social media. Supporters of the Congress and the BJP had both gathered outside the Imphal Airport for hours raising political temperatures.

 As soon as the reports of Asad Uddin gone missing surfaced, the mood at the Congress Legislature Party meeting at the State party headquarters turned somber. States Chief Minister since 2002, Okram Ibobi Singh evaded any questions from the media on the possibility of forming government. Meanwhile at the meeting, Okram Ibobi Singh was elected as the leader of Congress Legislature Party unanimously. Manipur Congres spokesperson Kh. Devabrata Singh said that the party will stake claim to form the government by meeting Governor Nejma Heptulla. With 28 Congress MLAs being elected the party is short of three legislators from the magic figure of 31 in the 60 member Assembly. The only legislature of Trinamool Congress T. Robindro Singh elected from Thanga Constituency is with the Congress, party leaders claimed, even though the MLA remains elusive so far.
