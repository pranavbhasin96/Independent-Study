  The BJP on Wednesday ridiculed BSP chief Mayawatis allegations of electronic voting machines (EVMs) tampering and asked her to gracefully accept the peoples mandate. When you win, EVMs are right. When you lose, EVMs are wrong. This shows that there are some defects in you (Mayawati), Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said outside Parliament. He said EVMs are under the control of the Election Commission (EC) which has dubbed the allegations as wrong. You should gracefully accept the peoples mandate. Peoples have rejected you (BSP), Mr. Naidu said.
