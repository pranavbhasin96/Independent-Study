 The Election Commission has ordered repolling in one of the booths of Lohaghat Assembly seat in Uttarakhand where EVMs malfunctioned, forcing the counting to be stopped midway. Repolling in booth number 128, Government Inter College at Karankarayat, was ordered after the EVMs stopped displaying results due to a technical issue prompting authorities to stop counting, the State election office said in Dehradun on Saturday night. Polling will be held afresh on March 15, 2017. Votes will be counted on the same evening. The poll panel has asked its State representatives to keep the documents pertaining to Saturdays counting for the Assembly seat sealed till the announcement of the booths results.
