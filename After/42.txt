 He first shot to prominence in July 2016 when he became the face of the Dalit backlash after four Dalit youths at Una were tortured by vigilantes for allegedly skinning a dead cow. As a member of the Una Dalit Atyachar Ladhai Samiti and the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch, he led a Dalit Asmita Yatra (a march for self-respect) from Ahmedabad to Una that mobilised thousands of Dalits across the State to come together and demand justice for the Una victims.
