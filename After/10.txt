  The Shiv Sena on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of resorting to histrionics and taking the ongoing poll campaign in Gujarat to a new low. The Sena, a critical ally of the ruling BJP in Maharashtra, said Mr. Modi dug up the graves of the Mughal regime in his campaign  instead of speaking about vikas (development)  to target the Opposition Congress. The people of Gujarat had already rejected the Congress for 22 years for this very reason... The PM chose to ignore the development issues and stooped to mere tu-tu, main-main (rhetoric) in his own home State, the Sena said in its mouthpieces, Saamana and Dopahar Ka Saamana.
