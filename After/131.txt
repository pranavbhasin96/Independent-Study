Mr. Singh was also being seen as one of the contenders for the post along with BJP State unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital with low blood pressure and attendant complaints on Thursday. Mr. Maurya, who was discharged from hospital on Friday, tweeted, On 18th March a meeting of U.P legislators will be held in Lucknow and all should reach there by 2 p.m. and the meeting would start at 4 p.m. Mr. Sinha, however, told reporters on Friday that he was not in any race.
