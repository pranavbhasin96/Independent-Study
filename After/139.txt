 Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband has expressed the hope that as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will take everyone along.  Maulana Qasim Nomani of the seminary said that the Darul Uloom was a non-political institution and had no affiliation to any political party. Becoming the Chief Minister has increased Mahant [priest] Adityanaths job. He needs to fulfil constitutional responsibilities as the CM and should take everyone along, said Maulana Nomani. Another important seminary in Deoband Darul Uloom Zakariya said the mandate given to the BJP had given them the job of taking every section along.  The electorate of U.P. have given an unprecedented mandate to the BJP which increases the partys responsibility. Yogi Adityanath has taken oath of taking every one along. He should fulfil that and should not do anything which hurts anyone, Mufti Arshad Farooqui told the media. Deoband hit the headlines after election results when the newly elected BJP MLA from the constituency, Brijesh Singh, announced that the name of the town will be changed to Deo Vrind. Mr. Singh said Deoband should be known for its historical association with Mahabharata and not the Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband.
