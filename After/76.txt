 Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla has asked incumbent Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh of the Congress to submit his resignation immediately, so that the process of formation of the next government can be started. Ibobi Singh, along with Deputy Chief Minister Gaikhamgam and State Congress president T.N. Haokip, had met the Governor last night. The Governor had asked Singh to resign immediately so that she can start the process of government formation, a highly-placed source in the Governors House said. As per rules, until and unless the present Chief Minister resigns, the process of formation of the next government cannot be started, the source said. It was during the meeting that Ibobi Singh had staked claim to form the next government by showing a list of 28 Congress MLAs. He also claimed to have the support of four National Peoples Party (NPP) MLAs. On seeing the names of the four NPP MLAs on an ordinary piece of paper, Heptullah asked Ibobi Singh to bring the NPP president and the MLAs, the Governor House source said.
