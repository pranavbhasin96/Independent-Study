  Rebel Rashtriya Swayansevak Sangh (RSS) leader Subhash Velingkar on Saturday claimed full credit for the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Assembly polls. Talking to The Hindu on Saturday, Mr. Velingkar, who formed the Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM) ahead of elections and fought the election in alliance with regional outfit of MGP, described the BJPs showing as a personal and moral defeat of Mr. Parrikar. He said that the reduction of the BJP seats from 21 to a mere 13 in the 2017 election was a big achievement of the GSM. Interstingly, the GSM failed to win a single seat out of the six it contested. This election has once again asserted the power of the people who had previously thrown the Congress out of power for not caring for public feelings on the issue of MoI at primary school level and have done same thing to BJP for its betrayal of the people, said Mr. Velingkar. On possibility of the MGP joining the Congress or the BJP in next government formation, Mr. Velingkar said though the GSM has not won a single seat, it would, as alliance partners, sit and work out the political strategy with the MGP. I expect the MGP not to align with the BJP, that is for sure, he said. The BJP misused the government machinery and police and even manipulated postal ballots, he alleged. He also said the demands relating to promoting regional languages in schools would be pursued by the BBSM and the GSM with the new government. We are not against any language like English. We are not against any community. We are just demanding that the national policy of promoting regional languages\mother tongue as medium of instruction at pimary level must be followed in letter and spirit in Goa as well, Mr. Velingkar said.
