  Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane on Thursday submitted his resignation to the Speaker of the Goa State assembly and announced his decision to quit Congress. The legislator who had won the February 4 election from Valpoi constituency of North Goa said that he will contest the election afresh from Valpoi on the ticket of local outfit of Sattari Yuva Morcha and support the BJP-led coalition government of Manohar Parrikar. Asked whether he will join the government, Mr. Rane, son of senior-most Congress legislator and former Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane, said that it was up to Mr. Parrikar. Mr. Rane, earlier in the day abstained from attending the State legislative assembly during the crucial motion of vote of confidence tabled by the Parrikar government thus allowing the motion to be carried by 22 vs 16 when the Congress strength in the House was 17. He had defied the party whip asking party MLAs to be present and vote against the motion. Mr. Rane had for the last couple of days publicly criticised Congress party Central leaders for failing to act promptly to form a government in Goa after election despite party having been elected as the single largest party in February 4 elections.
