When asked about BJP president Amit Shahs remark on Thursday that he had given Mr. Maurya the responsibility to select the chief minister, he said, It was said in a lighter vein. Whatever is my responsibility as partys State president, I will fulfill that.  There were conjectures within the party after Mr. Shahs remark as to whether Mr. Maurya, who is the BJPs OBC face in the State, is out of the reckoning. Though the BJP has formed governments in Manipur and Goa, it is yet to declare its chief minister in Uttar Pradesh, where it has got two-third majority.
