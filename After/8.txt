  Zero voting was recorded at Gajadi village in Morbi district of Gujarat on Saturday as the people, fed up with water shortage, boycotted the election. The village, though situated in Tankara tehsil of Morbi, comes under the Kalavad constituency of Jamnagar district. None of the 1,000 registered voters in Gajadi turned up to vote, officials said. Senior officials of the district administration said they tried their best to persuade the villagers to vote. Though the village is being supplied water through one pipeline, they say it is not enough and want another pipeline, said Morbi Collector and District Election Officer I.K. Patel. PTI
