  Congress leader P. Chidambaram said on Monday that Prime Minister Narendra Modis campaign in Gujarat had gone beyond bizarre and asked whether a political party should go to any length to win an election. At a rally in Palanpur on Sunday, Mr. Modi suggested that Pakistan was trying to influence the Assembly polls and claimed that some Pakistani officials, former PM Manmohan Singh and a former Vice-President met at Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyars house on December 6. Mr. Chidambaram wondered whether winning an election was so important that such allegations could be made against a former Prime Minister and a former Vice-President.
