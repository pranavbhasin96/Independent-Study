 In this election, North Gujarat and Saurashtra have been considered as Congress' strongholds and for good reason - the party has focused quite a lot of their campaign in these regions. Party president Rahul Gandhi had, in fact, started off his election with a visit to the famous Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar - a move that was criticised by the BJP who attributed his visit to a Hindu temple as a bid to win votes. Saurashtra - then BJP, now who? The Patel-dominated Saurashtra region in Gujarat is said to be the ruling-BJP's weak link in the plan to win in 2017. The region had voted in the first phase of the election and sends 48 legislators to the 182-member assembly. The region has waded through rough water in 2012 when BJP leader and former CM Keshubhai Patel split from the party and floated his own Gujarat Parivarthan Party (GPP).
