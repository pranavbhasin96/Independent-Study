Shiv Sahay Singh
 There seems to be no end to the suspense over government formation in Manipur, with the Congress on Monday saying Governor Najma Heptulla should call its leader Okram Ibobi Singh to form a government as it has emerged as the single largest party in the Assembly elections. In a late night development on Sunday, Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the Congress Legislature Party, met the Governor and staked claim to form a government. Prior to this, BJP leadership met the Governor and claimed that they have the numbers to form a government. Along with its 21 MLAs, the BJP has the support of four MLAs each from the Naga Peoples Front (NPF) and the National Peoples Party ( NPP) and one from Lok Janshakti Party ( LJP). Congress MLA T. Shyamkumar and Trinamool Congress MLA Robindro Singh have also expressed their support to the BJP led combination and were present at Raj Bhawan with the BJP leadership.
