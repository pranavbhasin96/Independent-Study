  The BJP on Sunday revoked the suspension of Dayashankar Singh, who had allegedly made derogatory remarks against Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati. Mr. Dayashankars wife Swati Singh, who is also the head of the BJP womens wing, won the Assembly polls from the Sarojini Nagar seat of Lucknow. Suspension of Dayashankar Singh has been revoked by party State president Keshav Prasad Maurya, party spokesman Harish Chandra Srivastava said. After Mr. Singh had made remarks against Ms. Mayawati, an FIR was registered against him on July 20 last year under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and other provisions. The issue was taken up by Ms. Mayawati in the Lok Sabha and later the BJP had suspended Mr. Singh, who was the vice-president in BJPs State unit.
