  With Manipur heading for a hung assembly, Manipur PCC President T.N. Haokip today said his party would form the next government with the help of like-minded secular and regional parties. The 60-member Manipur assembly is headed for a hung assembly as none of the political parties managed to reach the magic figure of 31. We are confident that we will form the next government in Manipur. We are already in talks with like-minded secular and regional parties, Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Haokip told PTI. Apart from the Congress and the BJP which had bagged 19 and 18 seats respectively and are leading in five and three seats, National Peoples Party (NPP) has won three and is leading in one seat. The Naga Peoples Front, which has an alliance with the BJP in Nagaland, too bagged three seats and is leading in one.

 Lok Jan Shakti Party too won a seat. Asked if the Congress is open to an alliance with the NPF, Haokip said, The Congress will never go for an alliance with the NPF and the BJP. We are open for alliance with any other party. On his party not being able to reach the majority mark, Haokip alleged massive rigging and booth capturing by NSCN(IM) in favour of NPF and BJP in several seats. The NSCN(IM) in order to defeat the Congress, had resorted to massive rigging and booth capturing in various seats in favour of the BJP and the NPF candidates. Plus the money power too had played a vital role in favour of the BJP. A section of people were also swayed by the BJPs false promises on the economic blockade, he said.
