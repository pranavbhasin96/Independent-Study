 Men in white kurta-pyjamas and women in white-and-red coloured saris gathered around Chief Minister Harish Rawat at his residence on Friday evening as Mr. Rawat and his wife Renuka Rawat played with colour and danced to songs of Holi a day before the counting of votes in Uttarakhand. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Rawat, the Congress chief ministerial candidate, appeared relaxed and confident as he received best wishes from well-wishers for Saturdays results at his office.  I have been receiving phone calls from my well-wishers, telling me not to worry and that they are with me. I told them that Im not worriedmy fate is sealed in the ballot box, Mr. Rawat said to The Hindu. At the Bharatiya Janata Party office, however, with its candidates away in their respective constituencies, there was no election-related hustle-bustle to be seen.  Speaking to The Hindu over the telephone from Ranikhet, the seat in the Kumaon region from where he contested as the BJP candidate, Uttarakhand BJP president Ajay Bhatt said that party members were confident about the victory.
