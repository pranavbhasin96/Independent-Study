The re-polling was held from 8 a.m. till 5 p.m. Reason not given The EC had on Saturday ordered the re-polling after the second phase of voting in the Gujarat Assembly polls, covering 93 seats of central and north Gujarat, on December 14. However, the poll panel did not specify the reason for the fresh polling at these six booths.  The EC had also directed that the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) slips of 10 booths in seven constituencies be taken into consideration during Mondays counting of votes as the presiding officers of these booths had failed to wipe out the votes cast during the mock poll from the control units. The counting of votes for all the 182 Assembly seats will be taken up on Monday.
