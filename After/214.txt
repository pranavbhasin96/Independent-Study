  NEW DELHI: The Gujarat election result may have ended up even closer but for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spearheaded the Bharatiya Janata Partys charge in the last leg of the campaign like a seasoned batsman who hits his way through the slog overs to take his side over the finishing line almost single-handedly, according to political analysts.On his home turf, the PM addressed as many as 34 rallies, emphasising on the need to retain a stable government, raising farmers issues in rural areas and reminding voters of the damage that caste politics can do to the unified Gujarati identity.Often breaking into a different dialect as he entered a new area of the state, he fashioned the campaign around himself, reminding people about how he would ride a bicycle to go from one place to another in Mehsana or worked relentlessly to get the state uninterrupted power supply, defying the Congress government at the Centre then, or even succeeding in helping the state get rid of gangsters such as Ibla Seth. It is a state that he knows like the back of his hand. He talked in the local Mehsana dialect here. He still has the aura of a dependable leader.Otherwise this election was for the BJP to lose, said Bhauji Parmar, a farmer from Visnagar. Analysts said Modis political messaging was simple  to counter anti-incumbency by exhorting voters to retain the BJP government that had a proven track record and that he would address all their angst.Modi characteristically made the most of Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyars neech (low) comment, turning into a caste aspersion and connecting it with Gujarati asmita (pride).When you bring in the Gujarati asmita factor, you cannot now see Narendra Modi different from it, said political analyst Shirish Kashikar. Be it the Narmada project or electrification of villages, it is very difficult to talk about Gujarat without Modi. It was suicidal for the Congress to bring in Modi in the campaign, said Kashikar.He said that Gujarati asmita has always been an important part of Modis speeches, more than a fifth of which focused on local issues including rural distress.A seaplane ride on the final day of campaigning became the defining image in the minds of many urban voters who came out in large numbers to vote for the BJP. The party won 43 of the 55 seats in urban Gujarat.It was like many of us voted for the BJP looking at Modi sitting in Delhi. There was no other incentive, said Ramanbhai Joshi, a government employee in Rajkot. Before his public rallies from Bhuj to Bhavnagar, Modi, silently acknowledging that the agrarian crisis was staring him in the face, started visiting the state almost once a month more than a year before the polls.While the Congress raised issues of remunerative prices for the produce, crop insurance benefit and tubewells, Modi assured farmers that he was their well-wisher who would think only of their long-term benefit.It worked in some areas and in some it didnt. But the party retained its strength in North Gujarat unlike Saurashtra, only because the PM chose to focus here, visiting the former thrice in the same month, said Rajubhai Desai, a farmer in Banaskantha.Officials in the Gujarat government said that Modi did address farmers issues, especially the adverse impact of demonetisation.In the past one year, they said, PM Modi launched a slew of welfare projects in North Gujarat and Saurashtra, most of which were to do with addressing farmers concerns, including the Sauni Yojana and the Sujalam Sufalam Yojana.At the same time, Modi reminded people about how curfew had ruined businesses and lives during the Congress rule in Vadodara and Surat, specifically taking names of places that were perpetually under curfew. He stressed on safety and security of people in the state and brought in Pakistan knowing full well that the threat of terror was real in Gujarat that has faced the Akshardham attacks and the Ahmedabad blasts.
