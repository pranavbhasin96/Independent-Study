  Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu allegedly violated the model code of conduct on Saturday as he, along with his family, entered the premises of a polling booth in private cars here, for casting votes. The four-time former MP, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu and their son Karan Sidhu entered the Mata Saroop Rani College premises along with their cavalcade of three private cars, sources said. Mr. Sidhu is contesting the Assembly polls from Amritsar East on the Congress ticket. As per the Election Commission guidelines, nobody should use their vehicles move on the polling booth premises, except physically challenged persons. Mr. Sidhu and his family were stopped at the main entrance of the polling booth by the paramilitary forces. But he gained entry by saying that he had special permission. On being contacted, Deputy Commissioner-cum-Returning Officer Basant Garg said a complaint had been received in this regard. We are verifying the CCTV footage. If it is proved that his vehicles were taken inside the premises, action will be taken as per the guidelines of the Election Commission, Mr. Garg said.  PTI
