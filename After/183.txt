  The investors on Dalal Street cheered the BJP winning Gujarat assembly elections on Monday as the benchmark indices recovered from the morning mayhem to end nearly half a per cent higher. BSE Sensex made a smart recovery during the day after initially plunging 800 points to end 139 points or 0.41 per cent higher at 33,601.68, while Nifty50 ended at 10,388.75, up 55 points or 0.54 per cent. PSU Bank stocks such as PNB (up 4.84 per cent), Union Bank (up 4.59 per cent), Syndicate Bank (up 2.93 per cent), Canara Bank (up 2.62 per cent) and Bank of Baroda (up 2.57 per cent) led the gains with Nifty PSU bank index (up 2.35 per cent) being the top sectoral gainer. It was an eventful day as Nifty witnessed a swing of nearly 400 odd points in early trade and finally settled with gain of over half a percent. Initially, markets reacted sharply on negative side, citing unexpected lead by the Congress in Gujarat election, but not for long. The situation completely reversed in next few minutes as BJP took over Congress in both the states and progressed towards comfortable win. However, volatility remained high on stock specific front, keeping the uneasiness intact, said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.  Nifty has again reached closer to its record high, clearly indicates that bulls are in control. Participants will now be at ease as there's no major event ahead and global cues will take over. We suggest keeping stock specific trading approach with bias on the positive side, Manglik added. Metal and pharma stocks also lifted sentiment as stocks such as Jindal Steel (up 7.31 per cent), Vedanta (up 3.84 per cent), Hindalco (up 3.23 per cent), MOIL (up 2.86 per cent), Cipla (up 2.58 per cent), Sun Pharma (up 2.11 per cent) and GlaxoSmithKline (up 1.64 per cent) ended higher. On the other hand, defying the overall upbeat sentiment were index heavyweights such as Infosys, ITC, HDFC, Yes Bank and Coal India that fell nearly 1 per cent each. Meanwhile, shares of fertiliser companies such as Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore, Southern Petrochemical Industries and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers gained after the Finance Ministry sought Parliament's approval for the net additional spending of Rs 33,380 crore ($5.21 billion) for 2017-18. Shares of Future Supply Chain Solutions got listed at Rs 674 on BSE, up 1.5 per cent over its issue price of Rs 664. The scrip ended 1.75 per cent higher at 685.80 on BSE.
