 Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh on Monday said here he would resign by Tuesday to facilitate the process of government formation in the State, which has got a hung Assembly after the recent elections. Governor Najma Heptulla earlier said that she could start the process of government formation once the incumbent Chief Minister resigned. Mr. Singh, however, has been arguing that with the Congress emerging as the single largest party, he should be given the first opportunity to form the next government. I am ready for a floor test and I have the numbers with me, Mr. Singh said.
