 The Congress is expected to submit its list of MLAs supporting the partys claim to form government in Goa on Sunday afternoon to the Governor Mridula Sinha, All India Congress Committee General Secretary Digvijaya Singh said on Saturday late evening. We will stake our claim with the Governor as soon as election of the Congress legislative party leader is over. We hope to submit our list on Sunday sometime in the afternoon to the Governor, Mr. Singh told presspersons in the city. He also said that he along with Congress leader K. Venugopal had been authorised by the party high command to initiate discussions with non-BJP MLAs and convince them to join a Congress-led alliance.  





 We would be talking to non-BJP MLAs. Bottom line is, there would be no compromise on the basic core issues of our election manifesto, Mr. Singh said
