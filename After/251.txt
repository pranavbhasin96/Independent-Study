  NEW DELHI: It is not often that a bureaucrat is trusted for 10 long years by his political masters, but in the case of Kuniyil Kailashnathan, he has clearly been a wanted man.Seen as one of the few most trusted bureaucrats of PM Narendra Modi, Kailashnathan has been awarded a two-year extension as the Chief Principal Secretary to Chief Minister of Gujarat on Wednesday. He is not only expected to play a crucial role in getting the states agriculture and irrigation schemes on track but also may monitor the end-to-end implementation of Modi's people centric policies in Gujarat to prepare the state for Lok Sabha polls in 2019.Kailashnathan had retired as additional chief secretary of the Gujarat government in 2013. But he was reemployed on a contract basis for two more years in chief ministers officer with a new designation-chief principal secretary. Having worked with three CMs Narendra Modi, Anandiben and Vijay Rupani, Kailashnathan, essentially Modi's man is known to regularly engage with officials in the Prime Minister's Office on Gujarat and policy-related decisions of the government.Believed to have gained Modi's trust by setting up Gujarat's extensive drinking water pipeline grid and through Hus work at Gujarat Maritime Board in privatisation of ports, Kailashnathan also held a number of key infrastructure positions in the government, apart from being the managing director of Gujarat State Financial Services.A top source in the government said it was possible that Kailashnathan would have been rewarded a good position in the capital or any other constitutional post had the BJP managed a sweep or even retained the scale of victory as last time.Kailashnathan's major achievements, according to sources in the government include the grid constructed around the Narmada basin that serve 70% of the states population, the state government's flagship Sauni Yojana taking Narmada water to Saurashtra and Van Bandhu yojna aimed at increasing the support of tribals for the state government.With the BJP forming the government with a thin majority, Kailashnathan's role, according to sources, will be far more crucial in the days to come, as the BJP prepares to counter the opposition that for the first time in many years will have a significant 77 seats in the assembly. His main work will be also to guide Vijay Rupani through bureaucratic and administrative hassles. KK's strength, sources said, was his ability to get work done out of people with a strict no nonsense attitude "He won't waste time even in offering tea or indulging in casual conversations with anyone. He is not interested in image building or coming into the limelight or being judged for his inter-personal skills. He doesn't sugarcoat issues so the PM takes him seriously," an official said.
