 BJP wins two seats in Manipur
 The three-time Chief Minister, who had established an insurmountable lead over Ms. Sharmila of the PRJA party, won comfortably with over 15,000 votes. Leitanthem Basanta Singh of BJP came second in the votes. Ms. Sharmila is also contesting from Khurai. Ms. Sharmila, who came in international limelight by continuing her fast-unto-death for 16 years to demand the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, entered politics saying she wanted to become Chief Minister to repeal the AFSPA. The 44-year-old Ms. Sharmila ended her indefinite hunger strike in August last year. She launched Peoples Resurgence and Justice Alliance in October last and said she will fight elections from Thoubal as well as Khurai, from where she hails.
