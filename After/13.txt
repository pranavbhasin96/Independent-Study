   The BJP hopes that the former Chief Minister Shankarsinh Vaghelas decision to quit the Congress will help it improve its tally in central Gujarat in the Assembly elections. Party leaders said they were also banking on the candidates who had switched over to the BJP from the Congress, and the consolidation against the Patidar agitation in the region, which is often called the KHAM (Kshatriya-Harijan-Adivasi-Muslim) belt. Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the absence of Mr. Vaghelas outfit Jan Vikalp Morcha from the contest would benefit the BJP. However, Dhamesh Mehta, the RSS organisational secretary in charge of the region, felt the fight was tougher this time. He agreed with Mr. Tomar on the Vaghela factor. Vaghelajis absence will help the BJP. Otherwise, it would have been difficult because he is a dominant figure among all castes of the Kshatriyas and has a hold over 8% of the votes, said Mr. Mehta.
