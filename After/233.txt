  In the Gujarat, the BJP came down by only 16 seats from its 2012 tally and the Congress was up by the same number, which might suggest that not too many MLAs would have changed. But in 102 of the 182 seats, the newly elected legislator is not the one who won five years ago.Of the 99 MLA's who have been elected on BJP's ticket in 2017, only 55 continue to represent the constituency they did in 2012. Similarly, of the 77 Congress members of the incoming assembly, only 23 were elected from seats they won five years ago. Apart from these tw parties, the only MLAs to retain their seats are NCP's Kandhalbhai Sarmanbhai Jadeja from Kutiyana and the Bharatiya Tribal Party's Chhotubhai Vasava, who was a JD(U) MLA in 2012.Even of the BJP's 55 returning MLAs, four were Congress members in 2012 and one an independent who contested on the party's ticket in 2017. Of the 115 BJP MLAs who won in 2012, 45 did not get a party ticket this time and another 20 failed to win their seat though the party backed them again. Thus, only 50 of the 115, or 43.5%, could retain their constituency.In the case of the Congress, of the 61 who won last time, 41 contested these elections from the same seats. However, 10 of these did not contest as Congress candidates but as BJP candidates. Thus, there were only 31 Congress MLAs seeking re-election to the same seat from the same party in 2017. Of these, 23 won, which means a mere 37.7% got re-elected on the party's ticket.This churn at the level of the individual MLA gets a little less subdued at the party level, but both parties have eaten into each other's turfs to a significantly larger extent than the net gain or loss would suggest. The saffron party retained 81 of the 115 seats it won last time, which means it yielded 34, all but one to the Congress.  The Congress in turn managed to retain 42 of the 61 seats that it won in 2012, meaning it ceded 19 of its sitting seats, though it more than made up through the seats it wrested from BJP and others. Of the 35 new constituencies that Congress won in these elections, 33 were held by BJP while two had sitting MLAs from the Gujarat Parivartan Party.The saffron party on the other hand added 18 new constituencies to its tally. Of this, 16 came from the Congress (including four defectors), one from the Nationalist Congress Party and one courtesy Inamdar joining the BJP.
