  In what could be a shot in the arm for the Narendra Modi-led BJP government just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, a number of exit polls conducted by various organisations have predicted a comfortable victory for the BJP in the Gujarat assembly elections.Almost all major exit polls have projected upwards of 100 seats for the BJP in Gujarat where the party is in power for more than two decades. The Congress, which hoped for a revival in the state, is expected to get between 65 and 75 seats. Today's Chanakya has predicted that the BJP will get 135 seats. The poll gave Congress a meagre 47 seats.The Gujarat election is being viewed as a semi-final before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress and the BJP campaigned heavily to win the state. The Congress party allied with the Patel quota agitation leader Hardik Patel in a bid to get a share of the Patel votes.The Congress party dismissed the findings of the exit polls and said it would wait for the final results to come on December 18 as exit polls had been proved wrong in earlier elections. The BJP, on the other hand, is confident of a landslide victory.
