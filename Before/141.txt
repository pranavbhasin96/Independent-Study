  Raising the pitch against the Congress government in Manipur, Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said here on Friday Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh would go to jail for having committed crimes against the State. A BJP government will be formed here and Ibobi Singh will go to jail because he has committed crimes against Manipur. For 15 years, he has kept the State backward. There has been no development here, only corruption, Mr. Javadekar, who is also the BJPs election in-charge for the State, said at a rally at Wangoi here. Accusing the State government of large-scale corruption, he alleged that huge bribes were routinely demanded for appointments to posts in the State police. Manipur goes to the polls in two phases on March 4 and March 8. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to address a rally here on Saturday even as the BJP, buoyed by recent civic poll victories and success in the Assam Assembly elections last year, is trying to topple the Ibobi Singh government. Blaming Mr. Ibobi Singh for the ongoing economic blockade by the United Naga Council (UNC) after the Chief Minister announced the creation of seven new districts, Mr. Javadekar said the Centre had worked hard to ensure supplies of essential commodities like diesel and petrol. Who is responsible for this blockade? Ibobi Singhs divide and rule policy. We, however, believe in Unite and Develop, he said. Mr. Javadekar, however, made no mention of activist Irom Sharmila, who is contesting the elections after an unsuccessful, 16-year hunger strike to get the Armed Forces Special Powers Act repealed.
