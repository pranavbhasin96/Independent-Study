 By Ravi SethIn the late 1970s, the KHAM (Kshatriya-Harijan-Adivasi-Muslim) alliance crafted by Madhavsinh Solanki got the Congress a rich haul of seats in Gujarat. A pre-poll arrangement  one involving Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBCs Alpesh Thakor and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani  has emerged this time too, with the Congress as the not-so-strong glue. Will it work? Heres a quick look at the state of the state:   BJP vs The Rest   What does an anti-BJP front mean? Patels/Patidars:   They have remained firmly behind the BJP since 1995, but things are changing now. The communitys new leader, Hardik Patel, is demanding reservation for the community in government jobs and in education and mobilising a section against the BJP.Dalits:   They comprise 6.7% of the state population. Recent violence against Dalits has strengthened their feeling of alienation, along with land redistribution policy and growing social discrimination. Mevani has asked his followers not to vote for the BJP. In 2012, BJP won 10 of 13 seats reserved for SC.   OBC:   Form 40% of state population. Their votes are split roughly equally between Congress and BJP. The latter now faces a tough fight with OBC leader Thakor joining the Congress.Tribals:   They are 15% of state population. Traditionally Congress supporters. But a pre-poll survey by the CSDS shows a shift to BJP due to popular schemes like Ujjwala. Tribal leader Chhotubhai Vasava, who broke off from the JD(U) and formed the party Bhartiya Tribal Party, has tied up with the Congress.
