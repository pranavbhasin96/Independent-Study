  AHMEDABAD: BJP president Amit Shah told ETover the course of an extensive interview that his party is confident of a massive victory in Gujarat and that the win will have an impact on subsequent elections, including in Congress-ruled Karnataka that goes to polls next year. He also said UP local poll results were an endorsement of BJPs development politics and that Rahul Gandhis extensive touring of Gujarat wont bring any dividends just as it didnt in UP. Had he (Gandhi) toured Amethi the way he is touring Gujarat, then perhaps at least his municipality would have remained with Congress today, Shah said of the Congress vice-president. He also listed a number of economic benefits for Gujarat courtesy PM Narendra Modi. These include increasing the Narmada dam height and a rise in fiscal transfer to Gujarat. But as the election nears, these people (local leaders that Congress has allied with) got exposed, he said.
