  Prime Minister Nasrendra Modi, while addressing a rally at Navsari in Gujarat, halted for a while during the Azaan. The prime minister resumed after it ended. The prime minister had paused his speech last year in West Bengal's Kharagpur when the Azaan started saying he didn't want to interrupt anyone's prayers. The prime minister, on Wednesday, addressed back to back rallies in Gujarat's Saurashtra region. He responded to Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's "Gabbar Singh Tax" jibe with "Great Stupid Thought" for his propsal to slash all taxes to 18 per cent. The prime minister, while addressing a rally at Morbi, said that the BJP government in Gujarat brought waters of the Narmada river by buidling big pipelines under the SAUNI Yojana while the Congress' model of development was limited to only handpumps. Gujarat will go to polls in two phases on December 9 and 14. The counting of votes will take place on December 18.
