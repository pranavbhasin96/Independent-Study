  Since 1980, there has never been an election for the BJP in Gujarat without a manifesto. In the past, announcement of the manifesto used to be a big affair for the saffron party with much aplomb involved. However, this time, curiously the BJP has been late in announcing its manifesto even while the Congress has done so.Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had lashed out at the BJP, saying that by not coming out with its manifesto for poll-bound Gujarat it has shown "unbelievable disrespect" to the people of the state.Polling for 89 assembly constituencies in the phase one will be held on December 9. The second phase voting will be held on December 14."The BJP has shown unbelievable disrespect towards the people of Gujarat. Campaign is over and STILL no mention of a manifesto for the people, no vision and no ideas presented for Gujarat's future," Gandhi said on Twitter.Although sources hinted that the manifesto might come out today, nothing has been confirmed as yet. Manifesto committee member Bharat Pandya told Mirror, "We have prepared the core issues of the manifesto and have submitted them to the coordination committee. However, I have no intimation of when it will be unveiled by the party." A senior BJP leader, however, told Mirror: "BJP has been ruling in the state for 22 years now.We are the party in power. We have worked for the development of Gujarat. When our sole intent is development of Gujarat, we don't need to come out with some kind of documentation." It may be noted that the BJP, during the three most recent polls, came out with a manifesto: in the UP civic polls, the UP Assembly polls and the Himachal Pradesh Assembly polls whose voting took place in November. It would not be a violation of norms if the BJP manifesto come out now, said an EC official.
