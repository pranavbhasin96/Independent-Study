  AHMEDABAD: As Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi went temple hopping during his Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat, and as the familiar tune of a soft Hindutva swing in Congress politics begun gaining traction, BJP supporters stormed social media with a 2-minute campaign video highlighting how PM Narendra Modi stood with Muslim women on the controversial triple talaq issue.The video is not part of BJPs campaign. Since I have not seen the advertisement I won't be able to comment on the issue, said Gujarat BJP spokesperson, Bharat Pandya, when asked about the video.The video clip shows two individuals visiting a Muslim home seeking votes. A woman wearing a burkha attends to them and blames them of votebank politics and having taken voters for granted for 60 years. The woman then praises Modi-led governments attempt in putting a stop to the zeher (poison) of triple talaq. The woman explains how women in her community were divorced on trivial issues like not cooking food appropriately or for being a little stout. The woman then refuses to vote for the party that does not pay to heed to their suffering.The Supreme Court on August 22, in a majority judgment, had set aside the practice of Talaq-e-biddat among Muslims. Also, the Union government has given indications that the Modi government plans to bring a legislation in the winter session of Parliament to end the practice of triple talaq and a ministerial committee has been set up to draft the said law.In his fourth Independence Day speech, PM Modi had praised Muslim women battling the practice of triple talaq and said the entire country supports them.
