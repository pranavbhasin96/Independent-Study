 The BJP is using several magicians to campaign for the party in Gujarat. A party leader in Gujarat said the magic campaign involved 36 teams of magicians, who will cover 144 constituencies and reach out to 800 villages in the next 20 days. Incidentally, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a magician who made money disappear from Gujarat through magic in the past two decades of BJP rule.
