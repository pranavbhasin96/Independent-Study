  Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das on Tuesday said that Gujarat voters were mature and the BJP would win the Assembly elections there.  The Congress, he said, would be swept away both in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.  Results of the Assembly polls of the two states will be declared on December 18.  Mr. Das told a press conference here that BJP candidates had been elected in the Uttar Pradesh civic polls with the people giving their approval to development and shunning casteism and communalism.  The BJP won 14 of the 16 mayoral seats in Uttar Pradesh and the elections were touted as the first litmus test of Yogi Adityanath after the BJP stormed to power in March.  The people had elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 on the issue of development, ending casteism, dynastic rule and communalism, Mr. Das said. The entire country has accepted our leadership, he said.
