  Controversial BJP leader Suresh Rana was booked for hate speech on Monday after he said that curfew would be imposed in Kairana, Moradabad and Deoband if he won in the Assembly elections. Mr. Rana, a riot-accused, is a sitting candidate from the Thana Bhawan seat. Uttar Pradesh police registered a case against him under Sections 505 (Making a statement with intent to incite) and 125 (Promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) of the IPC for his alleged hate speech.  It was found that Ranas statement violated the model code of conduct for elections. We have filed a case against him under relevant sections, said Sunil Kumar Tyagi, circle officer of Thana Bhawan.  Addressing a public gathering in Thana Bhawan on Sunday, Mr. Rana had said, If I lose, they will celebrate my defeat in Deoband. But if I win, then the next thing to happen would be imposition of curfew in Deoband and Moradabad, Mr. Rana said amid loud cheers and chants of Bharat Mata ki jai from the crowd.
