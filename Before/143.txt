 Addressing a well-attended election rally here on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to reassure the people of Manipur that there was nothing in the Naga Peace Accord  signed by his government with the NSCN-IM in 2015  that would go against the interests of the State. Mr. Modis assurance follows Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh's statement, asking why the precise terms of the agreement have been kept secret by the Centre. This accord happened a year-and-a-half back. I told Congress leaders what was in it. And today they are dividing Manipuri people. Will you accept the lies of the 15-year corrupt Congress regime or the truth of the Prime Minister who has served you honestly for two-and-a-half years, Mr. Modi asked the crowd. There is not a word in that agreement that can be construed as harmful to Manipuri interests, he added. Hiting out at the Ibobi Singh government for failing to maintain the supply of essential services following the economic blockade of the State by Naga students, Mr. Modi said, Is it not the State government's duty to maintain supply of essential commodities? As per the Constitution, this is the responsibility of the Manipur government and the police. What kind of government is it, under which there is a blockade and children do not even get milk? We will not let the blockade continue once our government comes to power in the State, the Prime Minister said. He accused the Congress of instigating people as well as paying those who organise bandhs. Mr. Modi added that a government that kept people hungry to win polls did not have the right to rule even for a minute. Mr. Modi defended the November demonetisation drive, saying his government was bringing out hidden money from 70 years of loot in the country and criticised Congress leaders for speaking against him after the note ban. Rest assured that I will take back the looted money. It can be used for work aimed at the poor, he said.
