 Betting trends claim a victory for ruling party BJP in Gujarat polls but with a reduction in the total number of seats. The betting market predicts as many as 107 to 110 seats for BJP and between 70 and 72 seats for Congress. BJP had won 115 seats in 2012 in the 182-member Gujarat legislative assembly, while Congress had won 68. According to the bookies at Phalodi and Bikaner betting markets, the trends are expected to change with Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing more rallies in his home state. Bookies say punters had lost a lot of money in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections held earlier this year as they had expected BJP to romp home with just around 192 to 200 seats but it went on win 235 seats. As a result, most people are now only playing on small bets; limiting it to up to Rs 50,000 while during the UP assembly polls, several individuals had put in amounts as high as Rs 1 crore, said a bookie. Regular punters are carefully watching the day-to-day developments and playing it safe, the bookie added. The market is slow and we expect a better business and may be, larger bets, only in the first week of December and then, after the voting is completed on December18. The current rate is 50 paisa if BJP wins and Rs 2 if the result goes the Congress way, he said. While bets are being placed over the results in Gujarat, the bettors dont seem to be interested in the Himachal Pradesh elections. The Gujarat polls are directly linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it is his home state. That is why there is so much hustlebustle in the betting market. But the same is not the case with Himachal Pradesh, said another bookie.
