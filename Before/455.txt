 Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over infant deaths and malnutrition among children in Gujarat. Gandhi has been attacking the prime minister over various issues in "a question a day" series on Twitter in the run-up to the Gujarat Assembly elections, demanding answers from him for "unfulfilled promises" made by his party. Posing the eighth question, he asked, "Thirty-nine per cent of children suffering from malnutrition. Thirty-three out of every 1,000 infants die. Rising cost of treatment amid severe shortage of doctors. Handed over a government hospital in Bhuj to a 'friend' for 99 years. Is this the example of your healthcare management?" Under the "22 salon ka hisaab, Gujarat mange jawaab (Gujarat demands answers for 22 years of BJP rule)" campaign, the Congress vice president earlier hit out at Modi over various issues including unemployment among youths and "poor" wages to workers, women's safety, education and health.  Gujarat, the home state of Modi, goes to polls in two phases on December 9 and 14.
