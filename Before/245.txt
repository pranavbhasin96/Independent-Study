  Elections in one constituency each in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were postponed on Sunday following the death of candidates. The Election Commission said here that following the death of Samajwadi Party candidate Chandrashekhar of the Alapur (ST) constituency, the election there has been postponed. Similarly, due to the death of BSP candidate Kuldeep Singh in a road accident, the election to Karnaprayag seat has been postponed. The polls in both places were to be held on February 15. As per law, if candidates of a recognised party die, the election is countermanded and party is given time to field a new candidate. The new poll dates will be announced later.
