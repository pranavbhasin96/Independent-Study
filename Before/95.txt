  In the wake of Cyclone Ockhi, the Election Commission on Tuesday issued instructions to the Gujarat Chief Election Officer (CEO) to ensure proper arrangements for smooth and efficient conduct of the first- phase poll process on December 9. The Commission has sought an action taken report by Wednesday for appraisal of the ground situation.  The electoral body has also directed the State and local administrations to make effective arrangements for immediate relief and rehabilitation works and to ensure that all the electors in the poll-bound assembly segments are able to exercise their franchise without any inconvenience. The EC had earlier on December 2-3 held a review meeting with senior administration and police officials in Ahmedabad. It has been brought to the notice of the Commission that a cyclonic storm Ockhi over the east-central Arabian sea, moving north-northeastwards, may cross south Gujarat and the adjoining north Maharashtra coasts near Surat by the midnight of December 5, said the Commission. The movement of this cyclonic depression over parts of Gujarat is likely to be accompanied by a wet spell over the next three to four days. The EC, therefore, has advised the CEO to keep a watch on the detailed day-wise forecast and warnings issued by the Indian Meteorological Department.
