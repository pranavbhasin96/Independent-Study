  The Congress on Sunday released its manifesto for Uttarakhand which focusses on stopping migration from the hills, disaster management, infrastructure development and economic empowerment of women. The State will go to the polls on February 15. Releasing the manifesto, Chief Minister Harish Rawat said the emphasis was on halting migration from hills caused by absence of employment avenues, economic empowerment of women and creation of basic infrastructure. Congress in-charge of the State Ambika Soni, Pradesh Congress Committee president Kishore Upadhyay and Kumari Selja were present.  The manifesto has set a target to make at least 30 per cent of unirrigated land partially or fully irrigated over the next five years. The disaster management mechanism will be strengthened by appointing five aapda [disaster] mitras in every village. Employment opportunities will be generated in the remote hill areas through renewed emphasis on skill development of local youth to stop the exodus in search of work, the Chief Minister said. The manifesto promises creation of new districts, development of infrastructure, boosting connectivity and building a modern Uttarakhand.  PTI
