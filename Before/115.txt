  The Congress has alleged that the then BJP government under the chief ministership of Narendra Modi had been involved in a scam worth 20,000 crore in the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Friday that the outflow of funds was at its peak during 2014 Lok Sabha campaign. This has never been spoken about, even CAG did not pick it up because of smart accounting. Money was systematically transferred offshore in the name of oil exploration, he said. The Congress leader alleged that huge cost overruns, mismanagement of funds and instances of undue benefits allegedly being passed on by GSPC to various private companies led to losses to the tune of 19,576 crore to the State government.
