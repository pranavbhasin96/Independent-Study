   Continuing with his posers to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the run-up to the Gujarat Assembly elections, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday posted his fourth question on Twitter: Why Gujarat stands at 26th position in terms of government expenditure on education? What is the fault of the youth? Mr. Gandhi also accused the Gujarat government of making a business of education at the cost of government schools and colleges, adding that the students are suffering from the rising cost of education in the State.
