 In one-question-a-day series, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday raised the issue of inflation and price rise. His tweet, however, was derided on social media for a simple calculation error. To highlight the 22-year rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Gujarat, Mr. Gandhi started the question series under the hashtag, Gujarat Maange Jawab (Gujarat demands answers). In the seventh edition of this series, he questioned price rise in the last three years. He demanded to know if the BJP government is only for the rich. To bolster his claim, he tweeted a table with figures showing the percentage rise in prices of gas cylinders, daal, tomato, onions, milk and diesel. However, all the percentages were inflated by 100 points on that table. That is, the table said, for example, dal prices have risen to 80 a kilo from 45 a kilo. Thats a percentage rise of 77%, but the table tweeted by Mr. Gandhis account showed a rise of 177% . The BJP had a field day on social media, highlighting the error in Mr. Gandhis tweets. Realising the mistake, within minutes Mr. Gandhi deleted the old tweet.
