 AAP National Convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday requested the Election Commission to withdraw his security during his visits to Punjab, where he has been busy with campaigning ahead of the Assembly elections slated for February 4. In a letter addressed to Punjabs Chief Electoral officer V.K. Singh, Mr. Kejriwal said, I have noticed that during my tours to Punjab, a large number of police personnel are deployed for my security, which, in my view, is not required and I want the withdrawal of the security provided to me. Our clear position is that given the poor law and order situation in Punjab, all the security apparatus shall be deployed for the safety and security of people of State, he wrote. I request you to take this decision to restore the confidence of the people, he added. Mr. Kejriwal said all AAP candidates had already made it clear that they did not require the security provided to them. The candidates have filed affidavits to the respective returning officers, stating that they did not need the security.  Special Correspondent
