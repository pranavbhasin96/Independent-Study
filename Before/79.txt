  Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan on Sunday termed the Gujarat model as Modi model, which he said supports crony capitalism. He also alleged that Gujarat has been lagging behind on Human Development Index (HDI) and on social development parameters. The Gujarat Model is actually the Modi model, which (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji is trying to replicate (elsewhere) in the country with only one person running the government, taking decisions single-handedly whether it pertains to the economy or foreign policy, Mr. Chavan said at a press conference here. The former Maharashtra Chief Minister alleged the Modi model was actually helping only big industries to grow.
