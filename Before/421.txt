PM Narendra Modi tweeted: Development has won again. My thanks to the people of UP. This win will inspire us to work for public good.The success in the civic polls is a significant achievement for Yogi who has also been drafted as a key campaigner in Gujarat. The party is banking on Modis enduring appeal in Gujarat to argue that any setback will weaken the PMs image as the frontrunner for 2019 polls  a tactic intended to counter quota warrior Hardik Patels appeal among the youth from his populous caste.The win, following better tidings on the economy with GDP growth rate breaking a downward trend and inching up again, helps BJP argue that it is the best option for longterm stability and improved business prospects despite unease over GST implementation and caste issues agitating groups like Patels and Dalits.
