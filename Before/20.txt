  Bharat Bhai Patel of Chapra village on the outskirts of Navsari town has postponed his sons wedding from December 10 to December 12. Weddings in villages are a community affair and go on for, at least, for three days. Our relatives from neighbouring places wouldnt have been able to attend the celebrations on December 9 since that is the voting day. Now, festivities can start after the vote, says 83-year-old Ichcha Behen Patel, the grandmother of the groom.
