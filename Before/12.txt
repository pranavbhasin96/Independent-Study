 Surat has been the epicentre of the Patidar quota agitation in south Gujarat and its impact can be seen in the way parties have given ticket to the community members. In 2012, the Congress and the BJP fielded 48 Patel candidates. In 2017, this has gone up to 53, with the Congress giving ticket to 25 and the BJP to 28. Since 1985, when Patidars clashed with the then Congress government led by Madhavsinh Solanki, Patels have voted for the BJP. Tarachand Kasat of the Congress says the party is confident of Patidar support. The Patels have a new slogan, Congress karo maaf, BJP ko karo saaf (Forgive Congress and oust BJP). Patidars have understood that the agitation damaged them too. Today, the situation has become normal, said C R Patil, BJP MP for Navsari.
