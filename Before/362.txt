  Mumbai: A few derivatives traders have latched on to a potentially high money spinning strategy which appears to have escaped the attention of most in this market. Thats a relatively low-cost strangle on the Nifty or Bank Nifty options expiring on December 28. The market, according to Rajesh Baheti, MD, Crosseas Capital, is selling options relatively cheap despite two high impact events next month  Gujarat assembly election results and the US Fed interest rate decision, both of which are due post December 10. The IVs (implied volatility) of both Nifty and Bank Nifty options expiring December are at least a percentage and a half to 2 percentage points lower, said Baheti, whose firm runs a large prop book for arbitrage and jobbing opportunities. Even a rise in IV can profit strangle or straddle buyers. IV is a traders expectation of estimated movement in prices. A call option on the Nifty or Bank Nifty profits a buyer if either the index rises above the options price or premium he has paid to the seller.An F&O; Play for Dec SeriesSimilarly, a put buyer benefits when the Nifty or Bank Nifty falls after his purchase. Even if prices remain more or less flat but IVs rise can the long strangle buyer make money. The strangle works as follows. Purchase a Nifty call of 10500 and a put of 10000 expiring on December 28. On Friday, after the Nifty closed at 10,284, the provisional price of the 10000 put was Rs 59 a share (75 shares equal one contract) while that of a 10500 call was Rs 87. A buyer puts up Rs 146, which on contract level works out to Rs 10,950. The buyer begins to profit if the Nifty closes above 10,646 (10,500+146)  the upper breakeven point (UBEP), or below 9,854 (10,000146)  the lower breakeven point (LBEP). The maximum loss is Rs 149, the premium paid, and happens if the Nifty stays between 10,000 and 10,500. The profit can be large if either IVs jump sharply or if the underlying index moves sharply up or down from the current level of 10,284. The UBEP is 3.5% above Fridays close, while the LBEP is 4.2% below the closing. For profit, the Nifty must move more than 3-4% from Fridays close either side. Analysts expect this to happen, given the significance of the two events. A landslide victory for the BJP in Gujarat elections just as much as a tepid victory or a loss could cause the Nifty to move much more and/or IVs to rise sharply from current 9 -14 levels. Similarly, the US Feds raising of the benchmark rate could also cause markets to move sharply, feels Chandan Taparia, derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal. Hemant Nahata of IIFL adds that a strangle could be a prudent strategy, given the low IVs and probability of sharp movements next month.
