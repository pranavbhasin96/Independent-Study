  NEW DELHI: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday cited the falling demand for Tata Nano cars, being built in a Gujarat plant, and questioned who was responsible for the failure of this 'Make in India' project. "PM's pet 'Make in India' project just died. (Rs) 33,000 crores of Gujarati taxpayer money turned to ash. Who is accountable?" he said in a tweet from his official account, adding a report about the failure of the cars in the market. According to reports, the car may be phased out due to falling orders. ATata Motors has a plant for the Tata Nano at Sanand, in Gujarat's Ahmedabad district.
