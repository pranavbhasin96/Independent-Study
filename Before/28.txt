  Fielding namesakes to confuse voters is a well-known tactic of parties. But happenings in the Jhagadia constituency in Bharuch district of south Gujarat takes the cake. Five-time lawmaker and JD(U) rebel Chhotu Vasava, who shot to fame during the Rajya Sabha election as the man whose lone vote made Congress's Ahmed Patel win, is pitted against Chhotu Vasava, a 50-year-old agriculturist. The farmer is a candidate of the Bharatiya Tribal Party and is backed by Nitish Kumar's JD(U). To make matters worse for the JD(U) rebel, he lost the fight in the Election Commission to use the JD(U)'s Arrow symbol. The case is being heard in the Delhi High Court.
