  The governments reported decision to consider introducing suitable legislation or amending existing provisions deterring instant divorce by Muslim men, in the forthcoming winter session, is a major milestone in BJPs efforts to engage with a section of the community. It also marks the unveiling of its strategy to revive the other in the changed electoral landscape of Gujarat.The timing of the decision, made within three months of at least two senior ministers declaring that a new law is not needed, is striking as the campaign is poised to gain momentum with the nomination process for the first phase concluding and Hardik Patel finally committing to oppose BJP.This rethink has to be assessed against the stated raison dtre  instances of Talaq-e-biddat coming to light even after the SC verdict  as well as Gujarats changed discourse, where BJP is pitting Gujarati asmita and gaurav against caste and class-based cleavages.In contrast to Gujarat elections since 2002, polarisation isnt an issue and so far poll is being contested on the issues of performance and social and economic grievances. The absentee Muslim identity  evidenced in Rahul Gandhis decision to steer clear of mosques and dargahs  indicates deep entrenchment of the Hindutva idea and victory for the Sangh Parivar, but paradoxically poses an obstruction to the Modi juggernaut.Besides addressing this challenge, the government decision restates PM Modis image of a decisive leader capable of taking tough decisions.The government move is likely to face opposition from conservative Muslims over efforts to arm police with punitive powers. Even in its absence, the move will be welcomed by BJPs core constituency among Hindus who consider polygamy a privilege to Muslims and view protection of the personal laws as appeasement.The demand for Universal Civil Code, it is to be noted, is currently backed most emphatically by stentorian Hindus. Most will surely view the development as another step towards a common social code and back BJP.It is worth recalling that BJP upped its campaign against instant triple talaq from October 2016, several months before UP elections.Despite existence of empirical data establishing significant and rising Muslim support for BJP in the state, its leaders claim the communitys backing was among the factors behind its spectacular victory in UP. This was attributed to leaders, PM Modi downward, taking up the cause of Muslim women by declaring commitment against Talaq-e-biddat. Such campaign subconsciously divides the community into two groups  good Muslims and bad Muslims.In public perception, the former includes Shia lobbyists and others willing to sing to the Sangh Parivars tune on minority issues, including Ayodhya. Those canvassing for the rights of Muslim women, despite having their own reasons for opposing gender-based discrimination, too get included in this group and depicted as backing the BJP effort.The bad Muslims firstly are historical personalities and clans responsible for 1,200 years of slavery, their modern progeny who include terrorists  Kashmiri or others  and even ordinary lawabiding Muslims who may just criticise government or BJP policies.Muslims were the principal other in assembly elections in Gujarat in 2002 and 2007 and came handy for BJP to mobilise Hindu support across caste and class lines.In the 2012 elections and during the 2014 parliamentary polls, polarisation on religious lines got somewhat subsumed by the sense of Gujarati pride built on the imminence of a Gujarati becoming the prime minister.Moreover by 2012, small sections of Muslims, finding that even Congress was no longer symbolically reaching out to them, began accepting BJPs permanence in the state and started voting for it in small numbers.With BJPs dominance coming into question in recent months, BJP was no longer sure of continued support of almost 20% of middle-class Muslims who voted for them in 2012.While a straight connection cannot be drawn between its push on instant triple talaq and the Gujarat polls, the diffused effect cannot be ignored. BJP is guided by the old dictum that every vote counts and is building small blocks in an attempt to restore its old vote base.
