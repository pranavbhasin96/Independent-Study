 BSP chief Mayawati on Sunday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah of dreaming of destroying UP, saying the public was disenchanted with the wrong policies of the Centre and the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh. Following the wrong policies of the Centre and State government, there is resentment and anger among 22 crore people of the State, Ms. Mayawati said at an election meeting here. Cast decisive mandate Both PM Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah are dreaming of destroying Uttar Pradesh, she said and urged the Muslim voters of the State to cast a decisive mandate in favour of the BSP. If you vote for the SP, then it will directly benefit the BJP. The Dalit vote base of the BSP is intact, and when the Muslim votes get combined with the Dalit votes, the BJP will face a tough time, Ms. Mayawati said. She accused the BJP of contesting the elections without any Chief Ministerial face. On the other hand, the SPs CM face is facing problems of poor law and order and a spurt in crime. As a result of which, the SP CMs face has become tainted, she said. The BSP chief took a jibe at Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, and said, He seems to have been affected by Putra-Moh (blind love for son), and has even insulted his brother Shivpal. On reservation system Sounding a word of caution, she said, The RSS and the BJP want to end the reservation system in the country. If the BJP forms the government in the State, it will either end quota system or make it ineffective.
