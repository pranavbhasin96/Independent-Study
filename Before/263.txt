  Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation saying people will take revenge on the BJP and its leaders will have to get blood pressure checked after third and fourth phase of polling. BJP has put common man in queue for their own money. Now in the elections they will once again queue up against BJP. BJP has come to know about the peoples mind and after the third and fourth phase, blood pressure of BJP leaders will have to be checked, Mr. Yadav told a rally with Mr. Gandhi by his side. When PM needs water in between his address and he has to wipe his sweat, then think how much people will make him sweat, he said. Mr. Gandhi said, Mood of Modi has changed after his friendship with Mr. Yadav and now smile has evaporated from his face. He has also come to know that in U.P., SP and Congress are going to form the government.  Like after Bihar polls, Modi did not utter the word Bihar, he will forget U.P. till 2019, he said. After showing film of achchhe din to people now he (PM) is acting like Gabbar Singh of Sholay and says he wants to fight corruption and turned your hard-earned money into paper. Now people will take revenge, said Rahul.  Trying to strike an emotional chord with the people of Bundelkhand, Mr. Yadav reminded them of empty water train sent for them by the Centre during drought and claimed that the State government had come to their rescue.  Mr. Yadav also attacked BSP supremo Mayawati and cautioned people not to vote for the BSP as it had joined hands with the BJP earlier. Mr. Gandhi, who was very vocal against the Prime Minister, said that after his 30-day Kisan Yatra he made a demand before Mr. Modi to waive loans of farmers but the latter kept mum when I met him in this regard. Now he is saying let BJP win and he will get the loans waived. Modiji you are PM, call a Cabinet meeting and waive the loans. For this you dont need to win elections, he said.
