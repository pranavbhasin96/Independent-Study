  Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modis chaiwallah narrative, senior Congress leader and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he did not want countrys pity on the basis of his humble background.  He was addressing a press meet in Surat on Saturday. I dont want the country to take a pity on the basis of my humble background. I do not think I would like to enter in any competition with Prime Minister Modi ji on this particular matter, he said to a question on why he doesnt talk about his background like Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.  His comments come in the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modis speech in Bhuj last week where he said he sold tea for a living but never sold the nation.  Earlier in the day, addressing a gathering of businessmen in the city, Dr. Singh said that while the jump in GDP figures were welcome, it was too early to conclude that this represents a reversal of declining trend of the previous five quarter.  To equal the UPAs 10 year average, the economy will have to grow at 10.6% in the fifth year. I would be happy if this were to happen, but frankly I do not think it will, he said.  Continuing his scathing attack on demonetisation, he said it was uninformed and a half-baked crusade. This is an uniformed, half-baked crusade on black money where he painted everyone to be a thief, while the real culprits have gotten away. Dr. Singh said in Surat 31,000 workers lost their job due to demonetisation.
