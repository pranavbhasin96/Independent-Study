  NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi has mooted the idea of single, unified all-India elections, citing spiralling costs of holding repeated elections in different parts of the country and the constraints placed on the government of the day by the model code of conduct that comes into force during any election. If we talk about the 2009 elections, Rs 1,100 crore was spent on the process, Modi said at the national law day celebrations here on Sunday. In 2014, it was Rs 4,000 crore. Governments also face problems in taking decisions with the model code of conduct in effect, he said. This is not the first time that the prime minister has spoken of simultaneous elections to all states and UTs along with parliamentary polls. His idea had earlier been backed by former President Pranab Mukherjee. There are nations where the date of election is fixed, Modi said. People know when it will be held. This is beneficial. The country does not always stay in election mode, policy planning process and its implementation is more efficient, and nations resources do not face any unnecessary burden," he said. Conducting elections every 4-6 months in different states is very hectic and costly, the PM said ahead of crucial polls in his home state of Gujarat. He called for a wider debate and dialogue on this.
