  The fifth list of the BJP had some surprises. BJPs Godhra MP Prabhatsinh Chauhan had asked for ticket for his wife Rangeshwari Chauhan, but the party has instead fielded his daughter-in-law, Sumanben Chauhan, from Kaalol. Ms. Sumanbens husband, Pravinsinh Chauhan, had lost in 2012 from Godhra Assembly segment.
