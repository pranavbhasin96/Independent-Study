  From the tribal reserved Jhagadia Assembly seat, the JD(U) has fielded Chhotubhai Vasava against sitting MLA Chhotubhai Vasava, who has left the JD(U) and is fighting the polls under the banner of the Bhartiya Tribal Party. Whether the JD(U) will be able to retain the seat with another Chhotubhai remains to be seen but the original Chhotubhai said that people of Jhagadia knew very well who was real and who was fake.
