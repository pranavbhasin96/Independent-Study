  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, kicking off the BJPs Manipur campaign, said that if his party is voted to power, blockades would be done away with. Speaking at a rally in Imphal on Saturday, the Prime Minister said that the Congress had done nothing for the improvement of Manipur and asked the people to vote the party to power to serve them better. "We will do in 15 months what the Congress has failed to do in 15 years," the Prime Minister said. If the BJP forms the next government in Manipur, blockades will not be allowed in the State, he said. There is nothing in the Naga accord which is detrimental to the interest of Manipur, Mr. Modi asserted.
