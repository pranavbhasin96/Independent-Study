 Congress party is in talks with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Sharad Yadav-led faction of JD-U over a possible alliance ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections. With discussions going on with both the parties, it may take a couple of days more to announce the list of candidates for the December 9 and December 14 polls. "Discussion on almost all the seats is over. Since we are also talking to JD-U (faction led by Sharad Yadav) and NCP, and the fact that they have also shown interest in an alliance, so the list will be released in a day or two," AICC General Secretary in-charge of Gujarat Ashok Gehlot told reporters after Congress' Central Election Committee meeting. "Though we have held discussions on all 182 seats, since we are forming an alliance, we may have to leave some seats. JD-U is divided into two parts. We are talking to Sharad Yadav about Chotubhai Vasava (rebel JD-U leader). "We are also talking to NCP..we will release the list when the talks are over," he added. There is also speculation that Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leaders and recently-inducted OBC community leader Alpesh Thakore held talks with Congress leaders in Delhi, to decide on the candidates for the Gujarat Assembly election. The last date for filing nominations is November 21.
