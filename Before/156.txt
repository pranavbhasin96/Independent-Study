 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at an election rally in Kotkapura in Punjab on Sunday, lashed out the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), saying the party will lose in the coming polls due to its antics in Delhi. "Those [the AAP) who have failed Delhi are coming to Punjab to destroy it. Send them back and tell them to first fulfil their promises in Delhi first."  Mr. Modi said Punjab is a border State and Pakistan is always on the lookout for any opportunity to use this land against India.  "If a government of outsiders comes in Punjab, it will neither be good for Punjab nor for nations security." Mr. Modi also took a dig at the Congress, saying, the "Congress has committed a sin of painting Punjabis, and Sikhs in particular, as terrorist." (With inputs from PTI)
