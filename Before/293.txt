 Just a day before Amethi and Rae Bareli go to the polls on Thursday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who could not campaign for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, has written a personal letter to voters of the two Lok Sabha constituencies, asking for their votes and attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for blocking welfare schemes.  She represents Rae Bareli and her son and party vice-president, Rahul Gandhi, Amethi. Ms. Gandhi mentioned that she could not campaign in the elections due to some reasons.  In an emotional appeal to the people to vote for the candidates of the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, Ms. Gandhi said, Despite wanting, I have not been able to come among you due to some personal reasons. It has been a matter of pride for me and my family that Rae Bareli and Amethi have become a part of our life and our existence. The special bond that we share is the biggest earning of my life.  The Congress president accused the Narendra Modi government of depriving people of welfare schemes, and said, It pains me that the present Central government is deliberately depriving you of welfare schemes. Have you seen any government which goes against its own very people? She accused the Modi government of snatching peoples resources on the pretext of acche din's promise.  Todays elections are very crucial. In 2014, the people of India, along with people of Uttar Pradesh, gave a lot to them [the Bharatiya Janata Party]. But instead of delivering the promised acche din, the Modi government snatched whatever you had. They took your land, your job and the hard-earned money,she said.
