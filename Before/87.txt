 The Election Commission on Monday issued directions that no newspaper advertisement be published on December 8 and 9 in poll-bound Gujarat without its prior clearance. In a direction to the Chief Electoral Officer of Gujarat, the commission said that instances of advertisements of offending and misleading nature were brought to its notice in the past. The newspapers, the Election Commission said, should also be informed against bringing out advertisements which were not cleared by the committee.
