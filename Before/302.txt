 The Congress on Monday asked the Election Commission to register an FIR against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for alleged violation of the Model Code of Conduct in Uttarakhand. Such action had been taken against the partys vice-president Rahul Gandhi for delay in concluding a roadshow, the memorandum submitted by Congress leaders said. The party alleged that on February 10, Mr. Modi had held a public rally at Haridwar without permission of the Commission.
