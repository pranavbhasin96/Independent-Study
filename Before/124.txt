    The witty litle Amul girl has morphed into a pro-Congress figure as part of a social media campaign for the Gujarat election, asking people to use their Amulya [invaluable] vote to oust the BJP. The posters do not feature the Amul Girl but a boy resembling her. The campaign is carried out by a loose group of artists, mostly from Kerala. Ten theme-based posters of the campaign have gone viral. Those behind the campaign say they are not Congress workers or supporters. They refused to be named as they dont want to come into the political limelight.
