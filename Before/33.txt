  The BJP on Friday released its fifth list of 13 candidates for the second phase of the Assembly polls in Gujarat, dropping two MLAs.  Of the 13 seats in central and north Gujarat, seven were held by the Congress. The BJP has so far named candidates for 148 seats out of 182. Among the candidates are actor Hitesh Kanodiya and Suman Pravinsinh Chauhan, daughter-in- law of Prabhatsinh Chauhan, MP.  Mr. Kanodiya will contest the Idar (reserved) seat, replacing Speaker Ramanlal Vora, who will now contest the Dasada (reserved) seat. Ms. Chauhan will contest the Kaalol seat in Panchmahal, replacing Arvindsinh Chauhan, MLA. Amit Chaudhary, who resigned as Congress MLA after allegedly cross-voting in favour of the BJP candidate during the Rajya Sabha polls, has been given ticket for the Manasa seat in Gandhinagar, which he represents in the outgoing Assembly. Prahlad Patel, who had joined the party ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls after resigning as Congress MLA, did not get ticket from Vijapur in Mehsana which he represented. Instead, Ramanbhai Patel will contest this seat. Laljibhai Koli Patel, MLA for Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad, has been replaced by a local leader Kalubhai Dabhi.
