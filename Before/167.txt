 PANAJI: Members of Chitrangi, a womens collective, met Goa Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Kunal on Monday to register their objection to the programme of giving pink teddy bear to first-time female voters, as announced by the commission in order to encourage voting. A delegation led by Prashanti Talpankar told the CEO that this caused an unwarranted discrimination between male and female voters. Mr. Kunal agreed to giving a pen to all the next time. Goa has more female voters than male voters as per latest electoral rolls. Goa has kept a target of 87-90% voting in the February4 election.
