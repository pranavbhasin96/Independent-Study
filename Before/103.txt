  A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the Congress party, comparing it with Mughal Raj and calling Rahul Gandhis elevation as Aurangzeb Raj, the Congress vice-president on Tuesday hit out at Mr. Modi, saying he devotes 60% of his speeches to the Congress while campaigning in Gujarat. Yesterday, I saw Prime Minister Modijis election rally speech. From what I saw, Modiji talked about the Congress party and me for 60% of the speech...that Congress party is this, Congress party is that, Mr. Gandhi said, while addressing a campaign rally in Kutch on Tuesday. This election is not about the BJP or the Congress or about me or PM Modi. This election is about the future of the people of Gujarat and what the BJP has for its future, Mr. Gandhi said.  This election is about just one thing, and that is the future of the people of Gujarat. And in his entire speech, Modiji did not talk about your future, as to what the BJP wants to do for you in future, he said.  He claimed that since the Congress had exposed the hype of their governance model, the ruling party leaders have become anxious and are only talking about the Congress. Exhorting the people of the State to vote for the Congress, Mr. Gandhi said: We can give you a golden future. The Congress chief minister will not take decisions without listening to you, without understanding you. We will not take decisions like (GST) Gabbar Singh Tax and note ban, he said. Mr. Gandhi said the partys manifesto released on Monday was prepared after taking inputs from people belonging to all walks of life.  It contains the voice of the people of Gujarat. We went to all sections and asked what we can do for you before framing the manifesto.
