  AHMEDABAD: Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that as Congress president his priority would be to strengthen the party and to change the political discourse.I would also like to change the discourse of politics. It has become nasty, ugly and there is a lot of anger and angst. We want to do politics of love and compassion, Gandhi said.Addressing the media here on the last day of campaign for the second and the last phase of Gujarat elections, Gandhi expressed confidence that Congress would win in Gujarat and said that he had expected a tougher fight from BJP.Pointing out that Congress stuck to its narrative of unemployment, issues relating to farmers, youth, health and education in Gujarat, Gandhi noted that BJP wavered from Narmada to OBC and for last couple of days Modiji spoke only about himself and Congress if you have noticed.Usually, those who keep their narrative intact win elections, Gandhi observed, adding that BJP in Gujarat could not play on its narrative. There is a hollowness in BJP, Gandhi said.And Gujarat has understood it, he added.Reacting to a question on Mani Shankar Aiyar, Gandhi said while his stand on such utterances has already been displayed through his action, the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attacked former prime minister Manmohan Singh is not acceptable.When asked about his repeated temple visits in the state, Gandhi quipped: Is there a ban on visiting temples? Earlier, I had gone to Kedarnath. Is Kedarnath in Gujarat? This is BJPs propaganda against me.
