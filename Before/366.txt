  AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said Gujarat was a role model for other states for choosing growth-oriented governance over the caste-ridden politics that the state had fallen into in the eighties. 2017 is a landmark election for the state which has gone through different kinds of politics, he said. The state needs to show with a historic majority that no one should think of anything other than development for the next 50 years, the FM said, adding: On the other side is an irresponsible group, an experiment which is dangerous for the state because it has no stake. He said what happened between PAAS and Congress on Sunday night  there was violence between the two groups over disagreement on seats  was a reflection of complete anarchy. It is unfortunate that a national party has become the nucleus for such anarchic parties. A national party is supposed to be the stablising factor. You are breaking and fighting even before the elections have begun. This is a textbook example of anarchy, he said. The FM said the core focus of Gujarat election will be to retain its stable government. Finance minister Arun Jaitley was addressing a gathering of prominent citizens in the city. Several businessmen, corporate heads were present at the Karnavati club event organised by the ruling party. Gujarat is an entrepreneurial state and a state like this always finds its way to success, Jaitley said, adding that Gujarat has gained from its politics. Highways developed, roads developed, port economy grew. Agriculture growth reached double digit. Urbanisation increased.
