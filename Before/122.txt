 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday stepped up attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking why there is no mention of development in his speeches during the Gujarat election campaign. Mr. Gandhi said he did not get an answer to even one of the 10 questions he had asked Mr. Modi on Gujarats report card, despite the BJP being in power in the state for 22 years, and wondered if governance meant mere speeches. BJP has its government in Gujarat for 22 years. I will only ask, what is the reason development is missing in the prime ministers speeches. I asked 10 questions on Gujarats report card but no answers came. No manifesto till the campaign for the first phase of polling ended. So, ab bhashan hi shasan hai (does governance mean mere speeches now), he asked on Twitter. Taking on Mr. Modi, the Congress leaders has started a question a day series on social networking site with the tagline 22 saal ka hisab, Gujarat maange jawab (22 years of account, Gujarat demands answers). The Congress is seeking to wrest power from the BJP and Mr. Gandhi has spearheaded the attack, often targeting the prime minister over the claims of development and questioning the Gujarat model As polling began on Saturday for the first phase of Gujarat elections, the Congress vice president welcomed the first-time youth voters of the state and urged all to help make the festival of democracy a success. Participation of voters is the soul of democracy. Welcome all the first-time youth voters of Gujarat. Appeal to all voters to vote to help make a success of this festival of democracy, he said on Twitter. The second phase of the assembly polls is on December 14. The results will be out on December 18.
