 The BJP has found a novel way to minimise the anti-incumbency mood against the MLA for the Mahuva seat in Bhavnagar district. The party dropped Bhavna Makwana from the candidate list, but fielded her husband, Raghavji Makwana, instead. By doing that, the party has ensured that the family stays happy while the electorate gets a new face to vote for.
