Under the banner of BTP, Mr Vasava has fielded candidates from three seats, Jhagadia where he himself is sitting MLA, Dediapada where he has fielded his son Mahesh and from Mangrol. All are ST reserved seats. Moreover, his trusted aide Anil Bhagat is contesting assembly polls on Congress ticket from Ankleshwar Assembly segment where the seat is non reserved but tribals are in dominant position.
