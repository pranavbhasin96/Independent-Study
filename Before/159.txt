 CHANDIGARH: BJP president Amit Shah said on Monday that Capt. Amarinder Singh of the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party were daydreaming about becoming Punjab Chief Minister.  Speaking at a rally in Amritsar, he said Capt. Amarinder, Pradesh Congress Committee president, rarely attended Parliament after his election as MP from Amritsar. Mr. Kejriwal, AAP national convener, was dreaming of becoming Chief Minister of every State he visited. Will you ever vote for a person [Capt. Amarinder Singh] who is an absent MP? One who has been missing since becoming an MP? Even if he manages to become the Chief Minister, where will you go to find him? He uses the title Captain, but takes orders from Rahul Baba [Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi], he said.  Targeting Mr. Kejriwal, Mr. Shah said: Some people are trying to do their best to defame Punjab. They are fooling the people in order to seize power. But the people know it all. Mr. Kejriwal wants to be the Chief Minister of Gujrat, Punjab, Goa  every State he visits.  Mr. Shah urged the people to vote the SAD-BJP alliance to power for the third time. The election in Punjab is an election for the security of the nation. Punjab is a border State, and it is the responsibility of the electorate to choose a government which can ensure secure borders, communal harmony and peace. Punjab is the heart of India. If it is secure, the nation is secure, he said.
