     Following in the footsteps of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav will campaign for the Gujarat Assembly polls. Mr. Yadav is expected to hold rallies in Gujarat over four days starting December 4. He will kick-off his campaign with a public meeting in Jamnagar. The SP president will seek votes for the party's five candidates. However, the larger strategy is to target the BJP government in the Gujarat as well as criticise Mr. Adityanath's work so far in UP. SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said Mr. Yadav would campaign in the Gujarat election to appeal people to strengthen secular and democratic forces against the communal and disruptive politics of the BJP. Mr. Adityanath, after holding more than two dozen rallies for municipal polls in UP, is already holding rallies in Gujarat. The UP CM is one of the star pracharaks of the BJP in the election and on Thursday he held a rally in Jamnagar. Mr. Chaudhary criticised Mr. Adityanath, saying he had left behind his duties in UP and gone to Gujarat to mislead people in the state. Akhilesh Yadav will tell the people of Gujarat how the BJP government has not fulfilled any promise made to people in UP, said Mr. Chaudhary. Meanwhile, the counting for the 2017 UP municipal elections will be held on Friday. Over 650 seats, including 16 Mayoral posts, are at stake in a four-way contest between the BJP, Congress, SP and the BSP. The BJP has all to lose as it is traditionally strong in urban centres and also won 10 out of 12 mayor seats in 2012. The polls are the first big test for Mr. Adityanath, who came to power in March.
