 Press Trust of India  Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Friday rubbished Prime Minister Narendra Modis claim of ISIs hand in the recent Kanpur train accident, and accused the BJP of trying to seek votes by misguiding people. Our Railway Minister could not take care of Kanpur tracks and gave a false report to the Prime Minister that the ISI had damaged the tracks. I want to say that since the incident took place in UP, at least I should have been informed about this...but there was no information... no truth in it, he said at an election rally here, the Lok Sabha constituency of Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha. The train accident in Kanpur on November 20 killed 150 people.
