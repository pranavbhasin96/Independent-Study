 NCW to quiz Hardik  The National Commission for Women on Sunday said its chairperson, Rekha Sharma, would meet the woman who was allegedly being sexually exploited by Patidar quota stir leader Hardik Patel. A team from the NCW with chairperson Rekha Sharma will be heading to Surat at night to meet a girl who, according to a complaint received by the NCW, was being sexually exploited by Hardik Patel, a statement said. The rights body also said the complainant was not the victim; however, she was willing to speak to the officials of the NCW. The NCW had earlier said it was also examining a complaint by Delhi-based lawyer Gaurav Gulati over sex videos, purportedly of Patel, that surfaced on social media. PTI
