 : The ruling Congress drew flak for announcing G. Tamang, a Nepali settler in Manipur, as its candidate for the Kangpokpi Assembly constituency. The seat was recently vacated by Ms. Nemcha Kipgen, the sitting Congress MLA. She joined the BJP and was given its ticket. When the Congress list of candidates for all the 60 constituencies was announced, there were sharp reactions from many circles. Several civil society groups expressed shock that the Congress, which has been in power for 15 years, should nominate an outsider. Manipur has been facing a protracted agitation for the implementation of the Inner Line Permit System to restrict the entry of non-locals. The Congress State leaders are refusing to explain the surprise move.
