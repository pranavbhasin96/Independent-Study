  NEW DELHI: The BJP may be facing possibly the strongest challenge in the Prime Minister Narendra Modis home state Gujarat, but Christopher Wood, author of the Greed and Fear Report, is putting all his money on a BJP victory for the sixth consecutive time!Gujarat goes to poll in two phases, on December 9 and December 14. The results will be out on December 18.The market veteran, however, warned that should the BJP lose Gujarat, it might prove Modis Waterloo. Modi will be finished in an event of the BJPs loss in Gujarat, he said.In a note to clients, the CLSA Managing Director and Equity Strategist said the odds of the BJP winning Gujarat elections remain high, even through the ruling party could secure the win with fewer seats than in the 2012 elections.While market watchers remain cautious over a possible swing among Gujarats trading community in the wake of the cash ban and GST rollout, Wood feels the opposition Congress has created a strategic blunder in trying to fight the election on GST and demonetisation.The CLSA strategist feels the Congress should have fought Gujarat, not on national issues, but on local issues. The opposition Congress is unconvincing under Rahul Gandhis leadership, he observed.Investors need to focus on long-term benefits and not short-term noise, Wood said.He feels Modi remains popular among small businesses and traders despite the hit from the cash ban and, in all likelihood, Modis core team is now focusing on their jobs  one area where there has been lack of progress  ahead of the 2019 electionsWood foresees acceleration in economic activity in India over the next 18 months. Modi seems keen on job creation with stronger focus on roads, affordable housing and textiles, he said.The impact of RERA implementation was clear in the September quarter results, which has led to a sharp decline in real estate sales and profits. RERA will be positive for realty players with strong balance sheets, Wood said, adding that positive effects of affordable housing would show in next 12-18 months.
