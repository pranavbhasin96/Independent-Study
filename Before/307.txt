 The Uttar Pradesh elections are about giving opportunities to the State's youth, ensuring safety of people and allround progress of the poor, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a public meeting in Mirzapur on Friday. The State government never paid attention to development works. The brass industry had been shut. The elections have turned into an 'utsav' of freeing the State from the ''misrules'' of the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress, he said. ''When Mulayam Singh was the Chief Minister, he promised the opening up of two new bridges, but why aren't they made yet?'' The BSP leader took away stones for building statues, but later, when questioned, shied away and said it came from Rajasthan, he said. ''In Uttar Pradesh, India has the strength to move forward. But from lodging FIRs to jobs, from pension schemes to ration card, corruption has badly gripped the State. We should eradicate corruption from the State and this election has opened the opportunity for it."
