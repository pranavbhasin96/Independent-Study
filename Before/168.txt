  Congress media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala on Tuesday promised transparent governance and accountable government in Goa.  The Congress, he said, would obliterate the governance paralysis under the BJP government. The Congress, he added, would institutionalise mining reforms, create a permanent mining fund and jobs.  A comprehensive tourism policy with ordinary Goans becoming stakeholders in making Goa a tourism hub and a special Goa Tourist Force & Police would unleash the States potential, Mr. Surjewala said.  The party also raised the issue of special status for Goa under Article 371 and preservation of Goan culture, heritage and flora and fauna, including protection for coconut trees. The AICC spokesperson said Goa should become free of drugs and crimes.
