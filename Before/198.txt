 The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance has emerged as the frontrunner in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls with 35% of the votes, says an opinion poll conducted in January by CSDS-Lokniti for ABP News.  The survey finds the BJP at the second position with 29% of the vote share and the BSP in third place with 23% of the votes.  The survey also says that Akhilesh Yadav is the most popular Chief Ministerial candidate in the State, with 26% of the respondents wanting him in the top post, followed by BSP chief Mayawati, who got the support of 21% of those polled. Based on the CSDS-Lokniti figures, ABP News has estimated a tally of 187 to 197 seats for the SP-Congress alliance, 118 to 128 for the BJP and 76-86 for the BSP. In 2012, the SP had swept the polls with 29% of the votes, leaving the BSP far behind though the party garnered 26% votes.  Significantly, the poll shows the SP-Congress leading in all regions of the state, except the areas close to Delhi, where the BJP leads. The poll also suggests that the internal feud in the Samajwadi Party has not affected Mr. Yadav's chances and in fact, shows that Shivpal Yadav is being blamed most for it. Modi still popular Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, remains popular in the State with a 70% approval rating. When respondents were asked to choose between the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister was four percentage points behind at 33%. Recently, a The Week-Hansa poll had predicted a hung assembly, with the BJP just ahead of the SP-Congress alliance and BSP a poor third. The survey put the BJP tally at 192-196 seats and the SP-Congress at 178-182 seats. The BSP was shown getting just 20-24 seats.
