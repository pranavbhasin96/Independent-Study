 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation saying people will take revenge on the BJP, and its leaders will have to get blood pressure checked after the third and fourth phase of polling in the State. The BJP put the common man in queues for their own money. Now in the elections, once again, they will queue up against the BJP. The BJP has come to know about the peoples mind, and after the third and fourth phase, BJP leaders will have to check their blood pressure, Mr. Akhilesh said with Mr. Gandhi by his side. Mr. Gandhi said, Modis mood has changed after his (Mr. Gandhis) friendship with Akhilesh. He has also come to know that in U.P., the SP and the Congress are going to form the government. Like after Bihar polls, Mr. Modi did not utter the word Bihar, he will forget U.P. till 2019, he said. After showing a film of achchhe din , he (PM) is now acting like Gabbar Singh of Sholay. People will take revenge, he said.
