  NEW DELHI: As polling begins in Gujarat in just two days, the final round of Times Now -VMR opinion poll has thrown up interesting results. BJP is projected to win the Prime Minister's home state comfortably but the target of 150 that the party set for itself seems distant. The survey projects BJP to win anywhere between 106-116 seats, that's well above the required majority mark of 91 seats.Congress under its President-elect Rahul Gandhi, and his grand alliance of caste grouping has not been able to convert crowds into votes, registering a minor increase in seats from 61 now to anywhere between 63-73 seats in the next assembly. Clearly the caste coalition hasn't worked as contradictory interests of Hardik- Alpesh -Jignesh worked at cross purposes for the Congress.   Times Now-VMR Opinion Poll was conducted by Votersmood Research (VMR), A total of 6,000 interviews were conducted at 684 polling booths across all four socio-eco regions of Gujarat. Interviews among eligible voters  covering all age groups, gender and the urban/rural divide  were conducted using a completely digital hands free interface, straight from tablet to computer.The study was done from Nov 23 to 30, 2017 with a margin of error +-3%.
