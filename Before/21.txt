  Vivek Jain of Vadodara city is a veteran in the business of election. He sells publicity material such as banners, badges, caps, flags and angavastram (stole) with party symbols. But he follows two inviolable rules: no matter how many times a candidate has won elections, he or she needs to pay up in advance. If one loses,they never show up. Rule two: never print photos of local leaders. I only print photos of Modiji or Rahulji. If they dont sell in this election, it can be stored for the next election.
