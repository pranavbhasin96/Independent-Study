 The Kanpur train accident in which 150 people were killed was a conspiracy and the perpetrators carried it out sitting across the border in Nepal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. Addressing an election meeting in Gonda district of Uttar Pradesh, which is close to the India-Nepal border, he touched upon the derailment of 14 coaches of the Indore-Patna Express, near Pukhraya in Kanpur Dehat district on November 20, and said the probe findings showed it was a conspiracy. The Kanpur rail accident, in which hundreds of people were killed was a conspiracy and the conspirators carried it out sitting across the border... Gonda is adjoining Nepal, he said. If the cross-border foes want to carry out their work, is it not necessary that more vigil is maintained in Gonda, he asked the people, urging them to vote for the BJP. Gonda needs to elect only those who are full of patriotism. Only then can we do anything good for Gonda, he said.
