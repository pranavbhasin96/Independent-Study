  The alliance talks between Gujarat Congress and JDU (rebel group), led by tribal veteran Chhotubhai Vasava, are experiencing some hiccups. Vasava is considered the staunchest of allies ever since his crucial vote helped Ahmed Patel win the Rajya Sabha seat a few months ago. The bone of contention, as per people privy to the tussle, is the Vasava camps demand to get over a dozen seats in the tribal areas of South Gujarat and Congress reluctance to part with more than a couple of seats. What has added to the tension is Congress staking its claim for the Dedipada seat, which Vasavas son Mahesh had won in 2007 but lost to BJP in the 2012 polls. Vasavas camp demonstrated its supremacy in the constituency recently by winning the maximum seats in the zilla parishad polls. The Congress side has argued that since JDU won only one seat (of Chhotubhai Vasavas) in 2012, the party led by him should settle for just a couple of more seats. However, Vasava-led JDU feels that it not only has pockets of influence in around 20 seats in the tribal area which could become the tilting factor in the Congress-BJP fight, it should also be allotted around a dozen seats. We are for an alliance with Congress to fight and defeat BJP in the polls, and JDU has credible support base in over 20 seats. Alliance or no alliance, we will carry on with our fight, Vasava told ET from Gujarat. The delay in finalising the alliance has also triggered whispers that some players such as the Shakarsinh Vaghela-led third front is also sniffing around Vasava even as he continues to describe Vaghela as a spent force.
