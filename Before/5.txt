 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani called on the former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel on Sunday to seek his blessings before filing his nomination papers on Monday for the Assembly elections. Mr. Rupani drove to Mr. Patels residence before leaving for Rajkot.  The Chief Minister is contesting the Rajkot (West) Assembly seat.  Respected Keshubhai is the eldest member of our party. So I had come to seek his blessings. He has spent his entire life dedicated to the party. I am leaving for Rajkot to file my nomination form after seeking his blessings. I feel blessed, Mr. Rupani told presspersons after the meeting. Mr. Patel was replaced as Chief Minister by Narendra Modi in 2001.  Mr. Modi too had contested the Rajkot (West) seat after being appointed Chief Minister then. He later floated the Gujarat Parivartan Party, which contested against the BJP in the 2012 Assembly elections. The party was later dissolved and Mr. Patel rejoined the BJP.  In September, Prime Minister Modi met Mr. Patel to condole his sons death before attending the ground-breaking ceremony of the bullet train project. Keshubhai Patels 60-year-old son Pravin Patel died after a cardiac arrest in the U.S. on September 9.
