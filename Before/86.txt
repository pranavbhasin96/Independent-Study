  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday compared the elevation of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi to the dynastic succession among Mughal rulers. Speaking at an election rally in Valsad a day he praised the bravery of Congress functionary Shehzad Poonawalla for calling Mr. Gandhis elevation a sham and rigged selection, Mr. Modi said the elevation was as expected as Aurangzebs succession. I congratulate the Congress on their Aurangzeb Raj, he said.  Mr. Modi addressed four rallies in Saurashtra and south Gujarat on Monday.  Responding apparently to remarks from Congress leader Mani Shanker Aiyer on the absence of elections during the Mughal rule unlike in the Congress, Mr Modi said, Aiyar asked did elections happen during Mughal rule? After Jehangir, Shahjahan came, was any election held? After Shahjahan, it was understood Aurangzeb will be the leader. So does the Congress party accept its a family party? He added, We dont want Aurangzeb rule here. For us, the well-being and betterment of people matters because we consider 125 crore Indians as our high command, he said.
