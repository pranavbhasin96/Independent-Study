  NEW DELHI: Ahead of the first 100% paper trail-based poll in a big state like Gujarat , the Election Commission has assured political parties and voters that all possible security protocols as well as checks and balances are in place to prevent any misuse of electronic voting machines and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPATs).As part of the elaborate safeguards, the EC said it had completed first-level checking of EVMs and VVPATs in the presence of candidates and party representatives; conducted mock polls; set candidates' names on the EVMs as per norms; and ensured stringent protocols for storage of EVMs/VVPATs before, during and after the polls; apart from videography and CCTV coverage of all EVM and VVPAT handling procedures."These safeguards are being implemented by ECI, in total transparency, with the active and documented involvement of political parties, candidates and their representatives at every stage so as to build their confidence on efficacy and reliability of EVMs and VVPATs," the EC said in a release on Friday.Gujarat has 50,128 polling stations, for which 81,860 Ballot Units (BUs); 66,358 Control Units (CUs) and 71,564 VVPATs have been deployed. This, EC said, translates into a more than adequate reserve of 63% ballot units, 32% control units and 43% VVPATs for the actual poll.In the run up to the elections, comprehensive cascaded training and capacity building of the election-related personnel has been carried out by the Election Commission. Training of 3,350 batches has been completed.Candidate setting in EVMs and VVPATs to be deployed in the first phase of Gujarat elections has been completed in the presence of contesting candidates or their representatives. For this purpose, the contesting candidates were invited by the returning officers through advance written communication under proper acknowledgement.Candidate setting in EVMs and VVPATs was done in a fully sanitised hall. Every person who enters the hall is frisked and only authorised officials are allowed to enter.Sharing the norms for candidate setting, the EC said the names in the EVM ballot paper are arranged in alphabetical order, first for the national & state recognised parties and then other state registered parties, followed by Independents. "Thus, the sequence in which the candidates appear on the Ballot Unit is contingent on the names of the candidates and their party affiliation and cannot be ascertained beforehand," said EC.After poll, EVMs and VVPATs will be sealed in their respective carrying cases and polling agents will also be allowed to put their signatures on the seals, which they can cross check before counting. Candidates/representatives will also be allowed to follow the vehicles (with escorts) carrying EVMs and VVPATs from polling stations to counting storage rooms. Even in storage rooms, an elaborate security protocol has been put in place including double lock system and deployment of adequate central paramilitary forces.
