  With the weather turning rough due to Ockhi cyclone, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's three public rallies scheduled for Tuesday were postponed, informed sources said. Gandhi was to address four election rallies ahead of the December 9 and 14 Assembly polls, including a public meeting at the Town Hall Ground in Anjar in Kutch district followed by another in Morbi district. Two public meetings were scheduled at Jinn Mill Ground at Dhrangadhra and M.B. Shah College Ground at Wadhwan in Surendranagar district. Gandhi addressed the public meeting in Anjar but the other rallies were cancelled. The unexpected cancellation left thousands of party supporters gathered at Morbi disappointed. It is learnt that a helicopter carrying the Congress leader could not land in Morbi due to rough weather. Gandhi was expected to return to Delhi on Tuesday evening. Authorities have sounded an alert over the cyclone, which was expected to hit the Gujarat coast around Tuesday midnight.
