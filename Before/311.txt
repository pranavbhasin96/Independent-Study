This road show among other covers three Assembly constituencies: Banaras Dakshin where Rajesh Mishra is a Congress candidate, Banaras Cantt. From where Anil Srivastav is the Congress candidate and Banaras Uttar from where Samad Ansari is the Congress candidate, said the letter. The Congress alleged that during the road show, the Prime Minister also went to Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Kaal Bhairo Temple without any requisite permission for conducting the road show from the Election Commission. It is requested that action may be taken and FIR registered against all the BJP leaders, including Mr. Modi, who were part of the road show, said the Congress complaint.
