  PORBANDAR: The birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi wears an old city look that lacks modern infrastructure but there is a keen contest between fisheries minister Babubhai Bokhiria and former leader of Opposition Arjun Modhwadia here this time. One knows its not smooth sailing for the fisheries minister when the fishermen (Kharva) community express disenchantment over performance of the state government and lack of delivery in the last five years. We used to get 130 litre of subsidised diesel. This has been reduced to 30 litre now. Other subsidies have also been removed. No dredging has been done on the seashore and this forces fishermen to go deeper into the sea, said Kishore Badershahi, a local fisherman. The highway leading to Porbandar is nicely surfaced but broken narrow lanes greet one inside the city. People complain that road maintenance has been on for months. With no new industry coming up, there is lack of job opportunities and there are allegations of widespread corruption too. Most voters say the candidates stand a 50:50 chance of winning but hint Modhwadia stands a better chance as Bokhiria faces anti-incumbency. Bokhiria and Modhwadia belong to the Mer community that does farming and businesses like transport and construction. Modhwadia, an engineer, is said to be accessible but many feel Bokhiria can be more effective. Kharvas and Lohanas (Vaishyas) seem unhappy with Bokhiria.Many fishermen say they ensured Bokhirias victory last time but would ensure his defeat this time, alleging he has done little work. Traders and jewelers who have traditionally backed BJP are unhappy too but unsure if they should vote for Congress. The youth say no new jobs have been created. PM Narendra Modis charisma may, however, change things for Bokhiria. Over the years, Congress members have moved to BJP. Congress is weak and have no presence at booth level. It is not seen as a strong alternative to BJP and is not at the Centre, said a shopkeeper.
