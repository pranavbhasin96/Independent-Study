 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday thanked the BJP for pointing out mistakes in his tweet question on Tuesday over inflation, but said unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he was human and did make the odd mistake. He asked the BJP to please keep it coming. For all my BJP friends: unlike Narendrabhai (Prime Minister Narendra Modi), I am human. We do make the odd mistake and thats what makes life interesting. Thanks for pointing it out and please do keep it coming, it really helps me improve. Love you all, he said in a tweet. The Tuesday tweet was part of his strategy to put one question daily to Mr. Modi ahead of the Gujarat elections. Mr. Gandhi on Tuesday asked if the government was working only for the rich, and pointed to rise in prices now compared to 2014  when the BJP came to power. However, the percentage-wise figures were wrongly calculated. Later, the tweet was corrected.
