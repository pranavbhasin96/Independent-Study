 Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his raincoat in the bathroom barb at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday that the Prime Minister was more interested in peeping into the bathrooms of the people. The Congress vice-president also said that the Prime Minister would get a jolt once the results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are out. Modi likes to read janampatri (horoscope), search Google and peep into the bathrooms of people...but he is a failure as a Prime Minister, Mr. Gandhi said at a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, where the SP-Congress alliance released a 10-point Common Minimum Programme. He [Modi] can do this [peeping into bathrooms] in his free time, Mr. Gandhi said.
