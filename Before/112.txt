 Asking his ninth question in the question-a-day series, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the agrarian crisis in poll-bound Gujarat.   Neither loan waiver, nor remunerative price for produce, neither received crop insurance benefit, nor were tubewells installed, he said on Twitter. The Congress leader also used the Gabbar jibe to target the Prime Minister. He had earlier referred to GST as the Gabbar Singh Tax. Agriculture hit by Gabbar Singh, land snatched and the farmer was rendered useless. PM sahib should explain why such step-motherly treatment with the farm labour, he tweeted.  The Congress has been traditionally strong in the rural pockets and farmers have been questioning the BJP government for the low prices for their produce and for not getting Narmada water. Under the ongoing offensive, the Congress leader is using the tagline 22 saal ka hisab, Gujarat maange jawab (22 years of account, Gujarat demands answers), in the run-up to the Gujarat elections starting December 9.
