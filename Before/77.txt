  Keeping aside their personal relations, two members of a family are contesting on ticket from rival political parties in Gujarat. Jaysukh Kakadiya is contesting as a Congress candidate from the Dhari Assembly segment in Amreli district, while his brother-in-law Kamlesh Kanani is the BJP nominee from the neighbouring Savarkundla seat. Mr. Kakadiya says his candidature was obvious as he has been with the Congress for over two decades. Same was the argument of Mr. Kanani, who also claimed to be a worker of the BJP for over 20 years.
