  AHMEDABAD: The Congress on Monday released its manifesto for the Gujarat assembly polls, promising a special category quota to Patidars, stipend to unemployed youth, cheaper fuel and farm debt waiver. The Opposition party has promised remunerative prices to farmers amidst palpable farm distress owing to lower remunerative prices for cotton, groundnut, potato and other staple crops in the state. Moreover, the party has also announced supply of 16 hours of power to farmers instead of the eight hours they get at present. The manifesto has been prepared after receiving inputs from all sections of society. We have prepared a comprehensive sector wise report on each and every commitment and promise the party is making to the people of Gujarat, said Gujarat Congress president Bharat Solanki. Another notable feature of the manifesto is special category quota to Patidars if the party comes to power. We will introduce a bill in the assembly to provide special category quotas to the Patidars, without compromising on the 49% quotas given to SCs, STs and OBCs, Mr Solanki said. According to Ashok Gehlot, party general secretary in charge of Gujarat, the main focus of the party is on youth, students, women, farmers, tribals and Dalits. For youth, we will set up 32000 crore of funds to support small and medium enterprises, stipend for those not employed and also subsidised housing for women, Mr. Gehlot said. For urban poor and the lower middle class, the party offers to reduce property prices, slash power tariff and give free healthcare, Mr. Solanki added.
