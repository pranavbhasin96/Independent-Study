  Hey there! This is Himani Sahni with ETMarkets' special weekend podcast. The coming week is going to be important for equity investors, and why not? We have the two-day RBI policy review lined up next week. But given that the market is widely expecting a status quo on the policy rate, it all comes down to Gujarat elections that kick off on December 9. Nobody on the Street is factoring in a BJP defeat. But market watchers remain cautious over a possible swing among Gujarat's trading community in the wake of the cash ban and GST rollout, even as they believe chance of any major surprise is low. The market may, thus, turn nervous as the state -- where the PM Modi hails from -- goes to poll. We have G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory with us, explaining how Gujarat election outcome can impact our markets: Byte 1 : G Chokkalingam We also have Nikhil Kamath, Co-Founder and Head of Trading, Zerodha to share his views: Byte 2: Nikhil Kamath Thats it in this special weekend Podcast. Do come back next Saturday for this weekly special, while you can continue to check out our regular podcasts on the equity market twice every week day.
