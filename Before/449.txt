  GANDHINAGAR: The Patidars, a community entrenched in its Hindutva moorings, is venting its disillusionment with the current governments ebbing Hindutva fervour through not-so-subtly campaigns on social media platforms. Messages like If you vote for those who caned the innocent VHP Bajrang Dal workers, then even Lord Ram cannot save Hindus, or Who do you think is in trouble? 1. Hindu 2. BJP, are being circulated across Whatsapp groups which have Patidars as members. Another lengthy appeal goes on to question what the Hindutva workers have achieved despite their years of hard work. These messages reminded the community members that although many of them had spent their lives working for the cause of Hindutva and Ram Mandir, the BJP was today devoid of people like Keshubhai Patel, Kashiram Rana, Vajpayee and has been hijacked by Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley, who have mocked their cause. Citing examples of how the Modi government in Gujarat had undermined the VHP and Bajrang Dal and how more than 500 temples were demolished by Narendra Modi in 2009, it goes on to say that the arrogant governance needed to be ended and to teach them a lesson, the Congress needs to be brought to power. There is significant anger among people in rural areas especially in the pockets where Patidars are dominant, said a source in the BJP, closely connected with the Patidar community. Requesting anonymity, he said Patidars, who have been the back bone of the Hindutva movement in the state, have been feeling disillusioned for a long time.
