  Former Union Minister Akhilesh Das rejoined the Congress here on Tuesday in the presence of senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.  Mr. Das, a leader from Uttar Pradesh, had left the party to join the BSP. Mr. Das called the occasion a homecoming for him, saying it was a mistake on his part to leave the temple of purity.  Reposing faith in Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he said he would work to ensure that the party did well in U.P.  Welcoming Mr. Das back, Mr. Azad said there was anger in the business community  in which the former has some support against the Modi government. Saying that he hoped Rahul Gandhi would be Prime Minister in 2019, Mr. Das said traders were unhappy as an impression had been deliberately created after demonetisation that they are dishonest.
