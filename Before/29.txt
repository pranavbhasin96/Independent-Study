  BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav on Friday said his party will perform better than the last Assembly polls in Gujarat as people have supported demonetisation and implementation of the GST despite some anger. He called the two measures taken by the Union government transformational and said no transformation is painless.  There was a need for such steps to correct the basic economics of the country, he stressed.  We will win with better margin than the last time (in Gujarat assembly elections). Some journalists have told me that despite some anger among the people, they (the people) will support the BJP..., Mr. Madhav said. PTI
