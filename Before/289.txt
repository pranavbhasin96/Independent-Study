  BSP supremo Mayawati and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav lambasted BJP chief Amit Shah on separate platforms on Thursday by for his Kasab remark, with Ms. Mayawati going to the extent of calling him a terrorist. The BJP president on Wednesday used the acronym Kasab, saying Ka (in Hindi) stands for Congress, Sa for Samajwadi Party and Ba for BSP. He had said that till Kasab was laid to rest, Uttar Pradesh would not have development. Kasab was the Pakistani terrorist who was arrested during the 26/11 Mumbai attack and hanged in 2012. In a stinging retaliation, the BSP leader said there cannot be a bigger Kasab than Mr. Shah.  Aaj apney desh mein Amit Shah se bada koi aur bhi Kasab nahin ho sakta hai, arthaat aatanki nahi ho sakta hai (There cannot be a bigger Kasab, meaning a terrorist, than Amit Shah in our country now), she said. At an election meeting in Ambedkarnagar, Ms. Mayawati said such language reflected the mindset of the BJP leader and was shameful. Mr. Akhilesh said, BJP people have lost the battle on the ground and so their language has changed ... We used to study that it was KA se kabutar, but these (BJP) people are teaching something else. This time, people were going to set your kabutar (pigeons) free.  Ms. Mayawati had earlier taken on Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he used an acronym to describe the three parties. SCAM is Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati, he had said at his first election meeting in U.P. Mr. Modi had this week described the BSP as Behenji Sampatti (property) Party. In her riposte, Ms. Mayawati called the BJP Bharatiya Jumla (rhetoric) Party and used Mr. Modis initials to call him Mr. Negative Dalit Man.
