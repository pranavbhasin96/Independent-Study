 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said on Wednesday that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi could not see development in Gujarat as his mind was trapped in a time warp. "Rahul Gandhi is unable to see development in Gujarat. His mind is stuck in the past when it was corruption all over Gujarat during their rule. Hindi proverb 'Sawan k andhe ko hariyali hi nazar ati hai' suits Rahul Gandhi," Trivedi told ANI. In his election rallies in the poll bound state, Gandhi has charged state and central governments of doing little for the poor people in Gujarat. He had also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government for demonetisation and poorly implementing Goods and Serviced Tax across the country. The polling for 182 seats of Gujarat Assembly will take place on December 9 and 14 and votes will be counted on December 18.
