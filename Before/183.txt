 Shivpal Yadavs isolation in the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party continues. After being shunted from the post of its State president, sacked as a Minister and reduced to a single seat, Jaswant Nagar in Etawah, the Chief Ministers uncle does not figure on the partys list of star campaigners sent to the Election Commission for the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections.  Number one on the list of 40 is Mulayam Singh, who is now designated party patron. All other members of the Yadav family  Dharmendra Yadav, Akshay Yadav (Ramgopal Yadavs son), Tez Pratap Yadav and Dimple Yadav, all MPs  feature on the list. So does veteran actor and Rajya Sabha member Jaya Bachchan. Many leaders and Ministers close to Mr. Shivpal, including Syeda Shadab Fatima and Vijay Kumar Mishra, have been denied ticket this time.  Mr. Mulayam and Mr. Shivpal did not attend the SPs function on Sunday where the partys manifesto was released, in a sign that a compromise within the family was yet to be reached. Rajya Sabha member Amar Singh, whom the Akhilesh team blamed for the family feud, is also missing from the list.  The SPs ally in the elections, the Congress, released its list of start campaigners on Tuesday. Party president Sonia Gandhi, vice-president Rahul Gandhi, his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are in the list.
