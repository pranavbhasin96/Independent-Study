  AHMEDABAD: Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader Hardik Patel on Wednesday said that the party has accepted the formula forwarded by the Congress for inclusion of the community under the OBC category.Hardik, in a media interaction in Ahmedabad, has said that the Congress has accepted their demand that would provide the community benefits similar to those extended to OBCs, without disturbing the existing 49% cap for reservation.Hardik further claimed that the Congress has committed that it would pass a proposal for reservation under Article 31-C and Article 46 of the Constitution, insisting that theres no law or constitutional provision capping the limit of reservation.He further said that the Congress has promised that a survey would be undertaken according to the provision of the OBC commission and based on the same, the benefits would be extended to the Savarna communities.He also said that the formula extended by the Congress has been accepted not only by the PAAS, but other community leaders as well, including heads of religious bodies such as Khodal Dham and Umiya Dham. Reacting to Patels declaration, Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel hit back at him, alleging that the young Patidar leader is misleading the community.Stating that Hardik stands totally exposed, Patel said that Hardik is speaking the language of the Opposition party. Going on the offensive, Patel said that while fools have demanded, fools have accepted too. Meanwhile, Sardar Patel Group (SPG) chief Lalji Patel and Umiya Dham head have denied Hardiks claim of sharing the Congresss formula with them.  TN formula on Congress Mind?  Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who negotiated with Hardik Patels outfit on its demand for OBC reservation for the Patidar community has thanked Hardik for announcing support to the Congress for Gujarat polls. He refused to divulge details of the quota formula but said it would be done within the framework of the Constitution. Congress had reportedly offered a Tamil Nadu-like formula that has ensured scope for over 50% reservations.
