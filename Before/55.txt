 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhis visit to the famous Somnath temple in Gujarat started on a controversial note as he was reportedly listed as a non-Hindu in the register. The Congress alleged that the partys media coordinator Manoj Tyagi had only signed on a blank temple register to facilitate the entry of media crews but subsequently Mr. Gandhis name was mentioned along with Ahmed Patel in the column meant for non-Hindus. In election season, this snowballed into a controversy as BJP supporters on social media accused Mr. Gandhi of lying about being a devotee of Lord Shiva. Why should there be a secretive air around Rahul Gandhi? He is one of the most important political persons in the Indian scenario. For Rahul Gandhi and Congress, religion is a matter of convenience and not devotion. Rahul Gandhi must answer this, said the BJPs Sambit Patra in Gujarat. The Congress called it a conspiracy. Addressing the media in Ahmedabad, its communication chief Randeep Surjewala said, We have no hesitation in saying that Rahul Gandhi is not only a Hindu but wears a sacred thread. While the Congresss official twitter handle released a screenshot of the visitors book at the temple where Mr. Gandhi had described it an inspiring place, Deepender Hooda called him an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva in Delhi.
