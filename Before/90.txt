 Former Finance Minister and Congress leader P. Chidambaram, in a tweet, on Monday slammed the BJP for terming PAAS leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakore and SC/ST leader Jignesh Mevani as "HAJ" and accused it of playing the "communal card and divisive politics". His remarks came after a poster was released on social media showing the upcoming elections as a face-off between "HAJ" and "RAM", which stands for (Vijay) Rupani, Amit (Shah) and (Narendra) Modi.
