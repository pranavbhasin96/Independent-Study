 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Friday slammed the NDA government, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi why he had delayed the winter session of Parliament.  On a two-day campaign tour in Mr. Modis home State, Gujarat, Mr. Gandhi said Parliament was shut down by the government so that none could ask questions on the Rafale deal or the financial dealings of Jay Shah, son of BJP president Amit Shah.  Parliament wont open till Gujarat polls are over because Modiji doesnt want questions about Jay Shah and Rafale being asked. Please open Parliament so that even I am able to ask a few questions about Jay Shah, Doklam and Rafael deal, he said.  The government has closed Parliament. Every year Parliament opens in November, but this year it will not open in November because of the Gujarat polls, he added.  Mr. Gandhi started his campaign tour from Porbandar where he visited Kirti Mandir, Mahatma Gandhis birthplace. He also interacted with fishermen, and slammed the NDA government for ignoring fishermen and their issues.  In Ahmedabad, Mr. Gandhi held an interaction with people in a Dalit skill centre in Sanand where he hit out at the government for overlooking the issues of small industries and businesses and also marginalised sections of society.  Calling the Modi administration anti-Dalit, Mr. Gandhi said Hyderabad University scholar Rohith Vemulas death was not a suicide.  Rohith Vemula did not commit suicide, in fact, he was murdered by the Government of India, the Congress leader said.
