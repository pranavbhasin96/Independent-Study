 The Election Commission has asked the Cabinet Secretary to have the photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed from the website of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana scheme, which is also being implemented in Uttar Pradesh, where Assembly elections were under way. In its letter to the Cabinet Secretary, the Commission said it received a complaint that the website pmaymis.gov.in, through which the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is being implemented in U.P., and registration is being done for the scheme, promotes the BJP by showing images of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation. The Commission, having considered the issue, has held that the depiction of photographs of the Prime Minister and Ministers is in violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and hence, these shall have to be immediately removed from the official website pmaymis.gov.in., said the letter. The EC also asked the Cabinet Secretary why the photographs were not removed from the government websites as soon as the MCC came into force on February 4, in view of the elections in five States.
