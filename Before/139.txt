  Three former IPS officers will be in the fray for the March 4 and 8 polls in Manipur. All three of them, T. Radheshyam, P. Dhanakumar and Y. Joykumar (a former DGP), had applied for BJP ticket after joining the party. However, only Mr. Radheshyam got the BJP ticket, from Heirok constituency. Mr. Dhanakumar from Keishamthong and Mr. Joykumar from Uripok constituencies have joined a local party and will contest as its candidates. Over 30 other politicians had jumped ship after they were denied BJP ticket.
