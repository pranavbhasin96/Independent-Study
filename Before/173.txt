The State recorded 15% polling in the first two hours of voting which began at 7a.m.  No untoward incident was reported in the State, with peaceful polling in all 1,642 booths, apart from minor delays or temporary suspensions at a few booths due to malfunctioning of EVMs or voter verified paper audit trail introduced across the State. While polling was rescheduled at one booth in Margao town of south Goa, in another polling booth in Vasco, EVM malfunction led to a suspension of voting for around two hours. EVM failure was also reported at a third booth in Cortalim in South Goa, poll officials said.
