 Gujarat BJPs Mahila Morcha has been singled out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a special campaign outreach. On December 1, Mr. Modi will be interacting with partys women workers across the State through the Narendra Modi App. This will be like a live video call and women from across the State will also be able to ask questions to PM Modi directly, said a source in the BJP. Those involved in the exercise expect at least 5,000 members of the partys womens wing to access this call. Questions can be put to the Prime Minister directly as in a Facebook live and he will answer a few of them, said the source. He (Mr. Modi) has always given tough assignments and portfolios earlier considered the domain of men to women leaders from the party. From Anandiben Patel being his choice of successor when he left for Delhi to be PM, to two women ministers, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman being part of the Cabinet Committee on Security, an unprecedented thing in India, said a BJP leader.
