For the Congress, the number was 50.29% and 42.1% respectively. Overall, 67.52% of candidates had education lower than class XII. Dinesh Shukla, a political analyst, said that India doesn't have any minimum education requirement to contest elections. "Initial elections had a large number of illiterate representatives," he said. "Educational standing has never played a major role in Gujarat politics. Two factors have remained constant over the years in selecting candidates  caste and winnability. That is another reason why few women candidates are fielded." Experts also point to the state's socio-economic markers. According to Census 2011, of the 6.04 crore population of Gujarat, 1.93 crore were illiterate. Over 80% of the population covered by the census had never been to college or institutions of higher education.NUMBER OF CANDIDATES WITH CRIMINAL CASES UNCHANGED SINCE 2012:   The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and the Gujarat Election Watch analyzed 923 of 977 candidates for the first phase of the state assembly elections.
