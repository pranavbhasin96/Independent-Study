 BJP president Amit Shah said here on Sunday that if the party formed a government in Uttar Pradesh after the Assembly elections, slaughterhouses would be banned across the State. Instead of the blood of cattle, there will be streams of milk and ghee flowing throughout the State, Mr. Shah said at an election meeting. Accusing the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party of destroying Uttar Pradesh, he said this election would end the politics of appeasement, casteism and dynastic rule. Exuding confidence that the BJP would form the next government with a two-thirds majority, Mr. Shah said, Once the poll results are announced, it will signal the end of politics of appeasement, casteism and dynastic rule in the entire State. Mr. Shah urged voters to give an overwhelming majority to the BJP, and strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that in the past 15 years of rule by the SP and the BSP, development had taken a back seat in the State. There is an acute shortage of power and medicines, and the common citizens, including women and traders, are feeling very much unsafe, he said adding that farmers were yet to get their dues from the government. Throwing an open challenge at Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP chief said, Counting will begin at 8 a.m. on March 11 ... and by noon, the counting process will be completed, bringing an end to the rule of Akhilesh Yadav by 1 p.m. The BJP chief took a jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying, On the one hand, the Modi government has released 104 satellites, and on the other, Rahul is pushing the cycle, which has already become punctured. The cycle is the symbol of the SP with which the Congress has forged an alliance for the elections.
