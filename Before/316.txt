 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Partys rivals, the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress would get electric shocks when the results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are announced. Mr. Modis sharp riposte in Mirzapur came as a response to a remark made by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had asked the Prime Minister to touch an electric wire in order to see if current flowed through it.
