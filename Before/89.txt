 The BJP is all set to encash its Uttar Pradesh civic poll performance in Gujarat by utilising newly elected mayors for campaigning here. The party has won 14 out of 16 mayoral seats in U.P. and the Mayors will be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday to seek his blessings. They will then proceed to Gujarat. The newly elected mayors will meet the prime minister over tea tomorrow [Tuesday] in Delhi. They are all devoted party workers and will be used where ever the party needs them, BJP state general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.
