  AHMEDABAD: The highest hopes for the Congress, which has not won an assembly election in Gujarat since 1985, come from the countryside  the 98 constituencies out of a total of 182 where rural votes are 75% or more.Unlike the 39 urban seats or the 45 rurban seats, where the Congress won just four and 14seats respectively in the last polls in 2012, it has shown a much better performance in rural Gujarat though it is still far behind the BJP.The party has won more than 30% of the rural seats in thelastfive elections. In 2012, the Congress won 43 seats against BJPs 50. The number of rural seats in the previous four elections was 115, which got reduced to 98 post-delimitation.The results in 1990 were the most striking, when the Janata Dal won 58, one more than the tally of BJP (33) and Congress (24).Since then it has been more or less a direct fight between the BJP and Congress. The Congress seat tally since then has remained in the 30s and 40s while BJP has performed in the range of 50 to 75.If the Congress has to win a majority in the assembly, it will have to considerably improve its performance in rural Gujarat, given the fact that it will not be able to make much of a dent in urban seats and at best it would be able to match theBJPs performance in rurban seats. Rural seats have been a Congress strong point. For example, of the61seatsthat the Congress won in 2012, 43 seats were rural. The Congress which is banking heavily on Patidars, OBCs, tribals and Dalits rightly hopes to further gain ground here, given the support which is coming from young turks - Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani.The 2015local body elections were the last indicator of which way the wind is blowing in the countryside. The Congress vote share in 230 taluka panchayats improved by 3.59% while in the 31 district panchayats the Congress vote share increased by 3.86%. The BJP, on the other hand, saw a fall in its share in taluka panchayats by 5.18% and in district panchayats by 6.28%.As of now, the Congress is in power in 146 taluka panchayats and 23 district panchayats and the BJP controls eight district panchayats and 79 taluka panchayats. Arjun Modhwadia, former Congress president, said, Voting in rural areas takes place on real issues which touches the lives of the people, viz. minimum support price, unemployment, education and health services. He said the urban areas have been communally polarized by the BJP but is confident the Congress will do well in both urban and rural areas as all sections of the society today are against the BJP.Yamal Vyas, BJPspokesperson, said, In the local body elections in 2015, we did not do well in the rural areas while we swept the cities and towns. Assembly elections are a completely different ball game.
