 Both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress were struggling to announce their candidates for the the second phase of Assembly polls in Gujarat till late on Sunday night, with the last day for filing of nominations due on Monday. The BJP is yet to announce the names of 35 candidates, while the Congress has not announced a single name, for the 91 seats that go to the polls in the second phase. However, according to sources, Congress leaders have told candidates to file nomination papers as the party will issue the mandate to them. More than 20 candidates received phone calls front the party high command regarding their selection as the candidate for their respective seats. We have informed our candidates and they will file their nomination papers on Monday, a senior party leader involved in the selection process said. The move was meant to avoid dissent from other ticket aspirants and avert a possible problem for the party due to multiple aspirants for the same ticket. The Congress has repeated all sitting MLAs in north and central Gujarat, which will vote in the second phase on December 14. In the BJP, too, the final list was delayed as top leaders were dealing with multiple names for several seats, making it difficult to make the final selection. Moreover, party leaders also held several meetings with former Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, who had earlier said that she would not contest the Assembly polls. However, on Sunday it emerged that top leaders Om Mathur and others were probably persuading her to reconsider her decision.
