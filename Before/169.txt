  Accusing the election authorities of not doing enough to check liberal money distribution by rival candidates all across Goa during the run-up to the Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said it had hired 1,000 spy cameras for distribution in the 40 constituencies to catch cash and liquor distributors in the act.  Spy cams are being distributed in all the 40 constituencies. This job should have been done by the Election Commission, but we will keep an eye on malpractices and lodge a complaint as and when someone is caught on camera, AAP national spokesperson Ashutosh told presspersons here on Tuesday.  Mr. Ashutosh said that in the St. Andre constituency, over 1 crore in cash had been seized from a rival candidate on Monday night in a search by the flying squad formed by the Chief Electoral Officer. He alleged that despite repeated alerts by the AAP about money being distributed to solicit votes, the Election Commission had failed to tackle the menace and instead filed an FIR against Mr. Kejriwal.  South Goa Magistrate Swapnil Naik said 17 lakh was seized during the raid in St. Andre, and efforts were on to locate its source.
