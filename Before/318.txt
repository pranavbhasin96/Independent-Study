 Minister of State for Human Resource Development and president of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) Upendra Kushwaha on Saturday criticised the BJP for scheduling a roadshow featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Varanasi. Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Kushwaha, who is part of the NDA and has three MPs from Bihar in the Lok Sabha, said that it was unseemly for Prime Minister Modi to have participated in a roadshow in his Lok Sabha constituency. PM ko roadshow main bhejna, yeh theek nahin hai (It is unseemly for the Prime Minister to be featured in a roadshow). Kisi rajya ke Vidhan Sabha ke chunav main yeh theek nahin hai, rally ya jan sabha tak theek thaa, (that he should do a road show in an Assembly election of a State is not right, holding a rally or public meeting is where it should have stopped), he said. He blamed the BJPs organisation for scheduling this event.  They should not have done so, he said. Mr. Kushwahas party had fought the Assembly polls in Bihar with the BJP in 2015. He did not do so in U.P., however, despite hoping to contest that way.
