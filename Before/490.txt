Swain said: "We received the complaint with screenshots about the linkage of EVM with WiFi or Bluetooth devices. So we rushed the collector, Porbandar, and our observers from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to the place. Their scrutiny says that there was no merit in the complaint by Arjun Modhwadia."The reasons for the high turnout can be attributed to the intense drive carried out by the ECI, though both the political parties -- ruling BJP and Congress - claim the massive public support for their party is the reason for the high turnout.(With agency inputs)
