  AHMEDABAD: Today's polling in the second and final phase of Gujarat elections comes after an intense campaign that turned shriller by the day as the battle swung from a deemed no contest to a nail-biter of sorts. Denied permission to hold a road show in Ahmedabad on the last day of the campaign, PM Modi on Tuesday flew from Sabarmati river on a single engine seaplane to Dharoi dam to visit Ambaji temple in north Gujarat.Faced with a similar denial, Congress president-elect Rahul Gandhi visited the Jagannath Temple in Ahmedabad and later held a media interaction. If the spectacle at the riverfront encapsulated BJPs appeal to its electorate showcasing the development model, Gandhis yet another visit to a temple was a nod to the partys strategic shift in an attempt to reposition itself as an alternative to BJP in Gujarat.Gandhi hopped from temple to temple during the campaign, even as he spoke mainly about the basic issues of the state of employment, healthcare and education in Gujarat. In a campaign that turned vicious at times, BJP flaunted its development work at the same time as it sought to contain the simmering anger of agitating Patidars and Dalits.The PM spoke of development work done during his tenure as CM. During the course of the campaign, the PM also invoked the Gujarati pride, spoke about the surgical strikes and accused Congress of stoking communal fire in the state. And then came Mani Shankar Aiyars neech comment.Modi lapped up the opportunity to list all the insults which have been heaped on him over the years, in a bid to turn this into another maut ka saudagar (merchant of death) moment. The PM followed it up by alleging Paks involvement in Gujarats election, referring to a meeting attended by ex-PM Manmohan Singh, ex-VP Hamid Ansari and others .Meanwhile, Congress sought to seek support of the agitating Patidars, Thakors and Dalits even as it maintained silence on Muslims. Amid all this, the agitating Patidars concentrated their might on mobilising voters against what Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti leader Hardik Patel called the arrogant and oppressive regime and held several meetings across Saurashtra, Surat and north Gujarat. After all these, it is over to the Gujarat electorate now.
