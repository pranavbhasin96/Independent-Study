 The Election Commission on Monday issued a notice to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for allegedly abetting the offence of bribery during a speech in Bhadohi on March 4. During a public meeting, Mr. Yadav said that he had heard that money was being distributed. He asked the voters to accept the money, but to keep the cycle (Samajwadi Party symbol) in mind. The EC issued the notice after a report from the State Chief Electoral Officer on Sunday. He has been asked to respond by March 7. The EC said bribing or abetment of bribery of electors is an offence under Section 171E of the Indian Penal Code and also a corrupt practice under Section 123(1) of the Representation of the People Act and thus, in the ECs view, his statement violated Model Code of Conduct provisions. The Commission had earlier got an FIR registered against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on a similar charge.
